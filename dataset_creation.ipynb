They were the last people\\\\nyou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just\\\\ndidn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t hold with such nonsense.\\\\nMr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made\\\\ndrills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a\\\\nvery large mustache. Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the\\\\nusual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her\\\\ntime craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a\\\\nsmall son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.\\\\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and\\\\ntheir greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think they\\\\ncould bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs\\\\nDursley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sister, but they hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t met for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley\\\\npretended she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing\\\\nhusband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered\\\\nto think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The\\\\nDursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even\\\\nseen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they\\\\ndidn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.\\\\nWhen Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story\\\\nstarts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and\\\\nmysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr Dursley\\\\nhummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs Dursley\\\\ngossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.\\\\nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.\\\\nAt half past eight, Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs\\\\nDursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because\\\\nDudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLittle tyke,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car\\\\nand backed out of number four\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s drive.\\\\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of\\\\nsomething peculiar \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr Dursley didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nrealize what he had seen \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 then he jerked his head around to look again. There\\\\nwas a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a map in\\\\nsight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the\\\\nlight. Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr Dursley\\\\ndrove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was\\\\nnow reading the sign that said Privet Drive \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 no, looking at the sign; cats\\\\ncouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t read maps or signs. Mr Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the\\\\ncat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a\\\\nlarge order of drills he was hoping to get that day.\\\\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something\\\\nelse. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help noticing that\\\\nthere seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr\\\\nDursley couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t bear people who dressed in funny clothes \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 the getups you\\\\nsaw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He\\\\ndrummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these\\\\nweirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr\\\\nDursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t young at all; why, that\\\\nman had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The\\\\nnerve of him! But then it struck Mr Dursley that this was probably some silly\\\\nstunt \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94these people were obviously collecting for something\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6yes, that would\\\\nbe it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr Dursley arrived in the\\\\nGrunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.\\\\nMr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the\\\\nninth floor. If he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills\\\\nthat morning. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though\\\\npeople down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after\\\\nowl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr\\\\nDursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five\\\\ndifferent people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit\\\\nmore. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d stretch\\\\nhis legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.\\\\nHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d for gotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of\\\\nthem next to the baker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know\\\\nwhy, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and\\\\nhe couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them,\\\\nclutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they\\\\nwere saying.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Potters, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s right, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what I heard \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 yes, their son, Harry \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nMr Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the\\\\nwhisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.\\\\nHe dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his\\\\nsecretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished\\\\ndialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back\\\\ndown and stroked his mustache, thinking\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6no, he was being stupid. Potter\\\\nwasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter\\\\nwho had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even sure his nephew\\\\nwas called Harry. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or\\\\nHarold. There was no point in worrying Mrs Dursley; she always got so upset at\\\\nany mention of her sister. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blame her \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 if he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had a sister like that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\nbut all the same, those people in cloaks.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\nHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when\\\\nhe left the building at five o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight\\\\ninto someone just outside the door.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSorry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was\\\\na few seconds before Mr Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet\\\\ncloak. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the\\\\ncontrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made\\\\npassersby stare, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today!\\\\nRejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself\\\\nshould be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAnd the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle and walked off.\\\\nMr Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete\\\\nstranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He\\\\nwas rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining\\\\nthings, which he had never hoped before, because he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t approve of\\\\nimagination.\\\\nAs he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nand it didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t improve his mood \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 was the tabby cat he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d spotted that morning. It\\\\nwas now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the\\\\nsame markings around its eyes.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShoo!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mr Dursley loudly.\\\\nThe cat didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat\\\\nbehavior? Mr Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself\\\\ninto the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.\\\\nMrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all\\\\nabout Mrs Next Door\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had\\\\nlearned a new word (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d). Mr Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley\\\\nhad been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report\\\\non the evening news:\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nowls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at\\\\nnight and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings\\\\nof these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to\\\\nexplain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The\\\\nnewscaster allowed himself a grin. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMost mysterious. And now, over to Jim\\\\nMcGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,\\\\nJim?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, Ted,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the weatherman, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know about that, but it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not\\\\nonly the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent,\\\\nYorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I\\\\npromised yesterday, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people\\\\nhave been celebrating Bonfire Night early \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not until next week, folks! But\\\\nI can promise a wet night tonight.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nMr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain?\\\\nOwls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a\\\\nwhisper, a whisper about the Potters.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\nMrs Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was\\\\nno good. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Petunia, dear \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 you haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t heard from your sister lately, have you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAs he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all,\\\\nthey normally pretended she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have a sister.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said sharply. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFunny stuff on the news,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Mr Dursley mumbled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOwls\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6shooting\\\\nstars\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d snapped Mrs Dursley.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I just thought\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6maybe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6it was something to do with\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6you\\\\nknow\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6her crowd.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nMrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr Dursley wondered\\\\nwhether he dared tell her he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d heard the name \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPotter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He decided he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\ndare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTheir son \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be about\\\\nDudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s age now, wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mrs Dursley stiffly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s his name again? Howard, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, yes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, I quite agree.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed.\\\\nWhile Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr Dursley crept to the bedroom\\\\nwindow and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was\\\\nstaring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.\\\\nWas he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the\\\\nPotters? If it did...if it got out that they were related to a pair of \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 well, he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nthink he could bear it.\\\\nThe Dursleys got into bed. Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr\\\\nDursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought\\\\nbefore he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no\\\\nreason for them to come near him and Mrs Dursley. The Potters knew very well\\\\nwhat he and Petunia thought about them and their kind....He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see how he\\\\nand Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he\\\\nyawned and turned over \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t affect them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\nHow very wrong he was.\\\\nMr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on\\\\nthe wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a\\\\nstatue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t so\\\\nmuch as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls\\\\nswooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.\\\\nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so\\\\nsuddenly and silently you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have thought he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just popped out of the ground.\\\\nThe cat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.\\\\nNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall,\\\\nthin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both\\\\nlong enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that\\\\nswept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light,\\\\nbright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long\\\\nand crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name was\\\\nAlbus Dumbledore.\\\\nAlbus Dumbledore didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a\\\\nstreet where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was\\\\nbusy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize\\\\nhe was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still\\\\nstaring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the\\\\ncat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI should have known.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a\\\\nsilver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The\\\\nnearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 the next\\\\nlamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the\\\\nonly lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which\\\\nwere the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window\\\\nnow, even beady-eyed Mrs Dursley, they wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be able to see anything that\\\\nwas happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back\\\\ninside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat\\\\ndown on the wall next to the cat. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look at it, but after a moment he\\\\nspoke to it.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at\\\\na rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the\\\\nshape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a\\\\ncloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked\\\\ndistinctly ruffled.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow did you know it was me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she asked.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear Professor, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be stiff if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been sitting on a brick wall all day,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\nProfessor McGonagall.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a\\\\ndozen feasts and parties on my way here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve celebrating, all right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said impatiently. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d think\\\\nthey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be a bit more careful, but no \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94even the Muggles have noticed\\\\nsomething\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going on. It was on their news.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She jerked her head back at the\\\\nDursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dark living-room window. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI heard it. Flocks of owls\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6shooting\\\\nstars\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6Well, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice\\\\nsomething. Shooting stars down in Kent \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He\\\\nnever had much sense.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blame them,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore gently. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had precious\\\\nlittle to celebrate for eleven years.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall irritably. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no reason\\\\nto lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in\\\\nbroad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nShe threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though\\\\nhoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, so she went on. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA fine\\\\nthing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared\\\\nat last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone,\\\\nDumbledore?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt certainly seems so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe have much to be thankful\\\\nfor. Would you care for a lemon drop?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA lemon drop. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re a kind of Muggle sweet I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m rather fond of.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, thank you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nthink this was the moment for lemon drops. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs I say, even if You-Know-Who\\\\nhas gone \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by\\\\nhis name? All this \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You-Know-Who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 nonsense \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 for eleven years I have been\\\\ntrying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Professor\\\\nMcGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops,\\\\nseemed not to notice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt all gets so confusing if we keep saying \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98You-KnowWho.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nname.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know you haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half\\\\nexasperated, half admiring. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re different. Everyone knows you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re the\\\\nonly one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou flatter me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore calmly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVoldemort had powers I will\\\\nnever have.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOnly because you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re too \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 well \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 noble to use them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lucky it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dark. I haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey\\\\ntold me she liked my new earmuffs.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe\\\\nowls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what\\\\nthey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re saying? About why he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most\\\\nanxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all\\\\nday, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a\\\\npiercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ceveryone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d was saying,\\\\nshe was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true.\\\\nDumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re saying,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she pressed on, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cis that last night Voldemort\\\\nturned up in Godric\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily\\\\nand James Potter are \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 are \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 that they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 dead.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nDumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLily and James\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to believe it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6Oh,\\\\nAlbus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6I\\\\nknow\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said heavily.\\\\n\\\\nProfessor McGonagall\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice trembled as she went on. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not all.\\\\nThey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re saying he tried to kill the Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s son, Harry. But he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. He\\\\ncouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re saying that\\\\nwhen he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s power somehow broke \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and\\\\nthat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nDumbledore nodded glumly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s true?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d faltered Professor McGonagall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAfter all he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s done\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\nall the people he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s killed\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t kill a little boy? It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just astounding\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6of\\\\nall the things to stop him\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe can only guess.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe may never know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her\\\\neyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden\\\\nwatch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve\\\\nhands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It\\\\nmust have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his\\\\npocket and said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s late. I suppose it was he who told you I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be here, by\\\\nthe way?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t suppose you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to\\\\ntell me why you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re here, of all places?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re the only family\\\\nhe has left now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mean \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mean the people who live here?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried\\\\nProfessor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDumbledore \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been watching them all day. You couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t find\\\\ntwo people who are less like us. And they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got this son \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I saw him kicking\\\\nhis mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come\\\\nand live here!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the best place for him,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore firmly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHis aunt and\\\\nuncle will be able to explain everything to him when he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s older. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve written\\\\nthem a letter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA letter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on\\\\nthe wall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cReally, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter?\\\\nThese people will never understand him! He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be famous \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 a legend \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I\\\\nwouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nthere will be books written about Harry \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 every child in our world will know\\\\nhis name!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExactly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his\\\\nhalf-moon glasses. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt would be enough to turn any boy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head. Famous before\\\\nhe can walk and talk! Famous for something he won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even remember! Can you\\\\n\\\\nsee how much better off he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be, growing up away from all that until he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ready\\\\nto take it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed,\\\\nand then said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 yes, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re right, of course. But how is the boy getting\\\\nhere, Dumbledore?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might\\\\nbe hiding Harry underneath it.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s bringing him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou think it \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 wise \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 to trust Hagrid with something as important as\\\\nthis?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI would trust Hagrid with my life,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not saying his heart isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t in the right place,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor\\\\nMcGonagall grudgingly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t pretend he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not careless. He does tend\\\\nto \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 what was that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew\\\\nsteadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a\\\\nheadlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and a huge\\\\nmotorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.\\\\nIf the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it.\\\\nHe was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He\\\\nlooked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 long tangles of bushy black\\\\nhair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and\\\\nhis feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms\\\\nhe was holding a bundle of blankets.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt last. And where did\\\\nyou get that motorcycle?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBorrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the giant, climbing\\\\ncarefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYoung Sirius Black lent it to me. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve\\\\ngot him, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo problems, were there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, sir \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before\\\\nthe Muggles started swarmin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 around. He fell asleep as we was flyin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 over\\\\nBristol.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of\\\\nblankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jetblack hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of\\\\nlightning.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs that where \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d whispered Professor McGonagall.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have that scar forever.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEven if I could, I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself\\\\nabove my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\ngive him here, Hagrid \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better get this over with.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nDumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nhouse.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCould I \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 could I say good-bye to him, sir?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Hagrid. He bent his\\\\ngreat, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very\\\\nscratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded\\\\ndog.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShhh!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d hissed Professor McGonagall, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll wake the Muggles!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cS-s-sorry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and\\\\nburying his face in it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I c-c-can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stand it \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94Lily an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 James dead \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 poor\\\\nlittle Harry off ter live with Muggles \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, yes, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be\\\\nfound,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as\\\\nDumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He\\\\nlaid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside\\\\nHarry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the\\\\nthree of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shoulders shook,\\\\nProfessor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually\\\\nshone from Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes seemed to have gone out.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore finally, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve no business staying\\\\nhere. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be takin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Sirius his bike\\\\nback. G\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99night, Professor McGonagall \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Professor Dumbledore, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself\\\\nonto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the\\\\nair and off into the night.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\nDumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.\\\\nDumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he\\\\nstopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of\\\\nlight sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange\\\\nand he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of\\\\nthe street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood luck, Harry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a\\\\nswish of his cloak, he was gone.\\\\nA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy\\\\nunder the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to\\\\nhappen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One\\\\nsmall hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was\\\\nspecial, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few\\\\nhours\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 time by Mrs Dursley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s scream as she opened the front door to put out the\\\\nmilk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and\\\\npinched by his cousin Dudley....He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know that at this very moment,\\\\npeople meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and\\\\nsaying in hushed voices: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo Harry Potter \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 the boy who lived!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn early ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their\\\\nnephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun\\\\nrose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the\\\\nDursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly\\\\nthe same as it had been on the night when Mr Dursley had seen that fateful news\\\\nreport about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed\\\\nhow much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of\\\\nwhat looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nbut Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a\\\\nlarge blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a\\\\ncomputer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The\\\\nroom held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.\\\\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long.\\\\nHis Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise\\\\nof the day.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUp! Get up! Now!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUp!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and\\\\nthen the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back\\\\nand tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one.\\\\nThere had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had the\\\\nsame dream before.\\\\nHis aunt was back outside the door.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre you up yet?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she demanded.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNearly,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you\\\\ndare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s birthday.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry groaned.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat did you say?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d his aunt snapped through the door.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing, nothing\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nDudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s birthday \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out\\\\nof bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after\\\\npulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because\\\\nthe cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.\\\\nWhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table\\\\nwas almost hidden beneath all Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s birthday presents. It looked as though\\\\nDudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second\\\\ntelevision and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a\\\\nmystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 unless of course\\\\nit involved punching somebody. Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s favorite punching bag was Harry, but\\\\nhe couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t often catch him. Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look it, but he was very fast.\\\\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry\\\\nhad always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and\\\\nskinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of\\\\nDudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin\\\\nface, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses\\\\nheld together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had\\\\npunched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance\\\\nwas a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He\\\\nhad had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever\\\\nremember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn the car crash when your parents died,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she had said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ask\\\\nquestions.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ask questions \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 that was the first rule for a quiet life with the\\\\nDursleys.\\\\nUncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cComb your hair!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he barked, by way of a morning greeting.\\\\nAbout once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper\\\\nand shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than\\\\nthe rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair\\\\nsimply grew that way \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 all over the place.\\\\nHarry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his\\\\nmother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not\\\\nmuch neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on\\\\nhis thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.\\\\nHarry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as\\\\nthere wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His\\\\nface fell.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThirty-six,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, looking up at his mother and father. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s two\\\\nless than last year.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDarling, you haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t counted Auntie Marge\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s present, see, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s here\\\\nunder this big one from Mummy and Daddy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right, thirty-seven then,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry,\\\\nwho could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon\\\\nas fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.\\\\nAunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly,\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll buy you another two presents while we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re out today. How\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that,\\\\npopkin? Two more presents. Is that all right\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nDudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said\\\\nslowly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have thirty...thirty...\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThirty-nine, sweetums,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Aunt Petunia.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right\\\\nthen.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nUncle Vernon chuckled.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLittle tyke wants his money\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s worth, just like his father. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Atta boy,\\\\nDudley!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He ruffled Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hair.\\\\nAt that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it\\\\nwhile Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video\\\\ncamera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He\\\\nwas ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from\\\\nthe telephone looking both angry and worried.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBad news, Vernon,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMrs Figg\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s broken her leg. She can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\ntake him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She jerked her head in Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s direction.\\\\nDudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heart gave a leap. Every\\\\nyear on Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to\\\\nadventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was\\\\nleft behind with Mrs Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry\\\\nhated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs Figg made him\\\\nlook at photographs of all the cats she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d ever owned.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though\\\\nhe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs Figg had broken\\\\nher leg, but it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year\\\\nbefore he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr Paws, and Tufty again.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe could phone Marge,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Uncle Vernon suggested.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t there\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t understand\\\\nthem, like a slug.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat about what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s-her-name, your friend \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Yvonne?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn vacation in Majorca,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d snapped Aunt Petunia.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou could just leave me here,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry put in hopefully (he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be able to\\\\nwatch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on\\\\nDudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s computer).\\\\nAunt Petunia looked as though she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just swallowed a lemon.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd come back and find the house in ruins?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she snarled.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blow up the house,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, but they weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t listening.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose we could take him to the zoo,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Aunt Petunia slowly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\nand leave him in the car.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat car\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s new, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not sitting in it alone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nDudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t really crying \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it had\\\\nbeen years since he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d really cried \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 but he knew that if he screwed up his face\\\\nand wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDinky Duddydums, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t cry, Mummy won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t let him spoil your special\\\\nday!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she cried, flinging her arms around him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6want\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6him\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6t-t-to come!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dudley yelled between huge,\\\\npretend sobs. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe always sp-spoils everything!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He shot Harry a nasty grin\\\\nthrough the gap in his mother\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arms.\\\\nJust then, the doorbell rang \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, good Lord, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re here!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Aunt\\\\nPetunia frantically \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and a moment later, Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s best friend, Piers Polkiss,\\\\nwalked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He\\\\nwas usually the one who held people\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit\\\\nthem. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.\\\\nHalf an hour later, Harry, who couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe his luck, was sitting in the\\\\nback of the Dursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the\\\\nfirst time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been able to think of anything else\\\\nto do with him, but before they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m warning you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he had said, putting his large purple face right up\\\\nclose to Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m warning you now, boy \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 any funny business, anything at\\\\nall \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not going to do anything,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9chonestly\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nBut Uncle Vernon didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe him. No one ever did.\\\\nThe problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was\\\\njust no good telling the Dursleys he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make them happen.\\\\nOnce, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking\\\\nas though he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his\\\\nhair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cto hide that\\\\nhorrible scar.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless\\\\nnight imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his\\\\nbaggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to\\\\nfind his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had\\\\nbeen given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain\\\\nthat he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t explain how it had grown back so quickly.\\\\nAnother time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting\\\\nold sweater of Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to\\\\npull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have\\\\nfitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided\\\\nit must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t punished.\\\\nOn the other hand, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the\\\\nroof of the school kitchens. Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gang had been chasing him as usual when,\\\\nas much to Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s surprise as anyone else\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, there he was sitting on the\\\\nchimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nheadmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d\\\\ntried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his\\\\ncupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry\\\\nsupposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.\\\\nBut today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with\\\\nDudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t school, his\\\\ncupboard, or Mrs Figg\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cabbage-smelling living room.\\\\nWhile he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to\\\\ncomplain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and\\\\nHarry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, as a\\\\nmotorcycle overtook them.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI had a dream about a motorcycle,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, remembering suddenly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was flying.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nUncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around\\\\nin his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache:\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMOTORCYCLES DON\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99T FLY!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nDudley and Piers sniggered.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know they don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was only a dream.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nBut he wished he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t said anything. If there was one thing the\\\\nDursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about\\\\nanything acting in a way it shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a\\\\ncartoon \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.\\\\nIt was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The\\\\nDursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and\\\\nthen, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before\\\\nthey could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nbad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head\\\\nwho looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blond.\\\\nHarry had the best morning he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had in a long time. He was careful to\\\\nwalk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were\\\\nstarting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t fall back on their\\\\nfavorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley\\\\nhad a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have enough ice cream on\\\\ntop, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the\\\\nfirst.\\\\nHarry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to\\\\nlast.\\\\nAfter lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there,\\\\nwith lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and\\\\nsnakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and\\\\nPiers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons.\\\\nDudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its\\\\nbody twice around Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s car and crushed it into a trash can \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 but at\\\\nthe moment it didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.\\\\nDudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the\\\\nglistening brown coils.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMake it move,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the\\\\nglass, but the snake didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t budge.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo it again,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly\\\\nwith his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is boring,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.\\\\nHarry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He\\\\nwouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 no company\\\\nexcept stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all\\\\nday long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only\\\\nvisitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got\\\\nto visit the rest of the house.\\\\nThe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised\\\\nits head until its eyes were on a level with Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s.\\\\nIt winked.\\\\nHarry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was\\\\nwatching. They weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.\\\\nThe snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised\\\\nits eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI get that all the time.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sure the\\\\nsnake could hear him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt must be really annoying.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe snake nodded vigorously.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere do you come from, anyway?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked.\\\\nThe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at\\\\nit.\\\\nBoa Constrictor, Brazil.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWas it nice there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on:\\\\nThis specimen was bred in the zoo. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, I see \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 so you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never been to\\\\nBrazil?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAs the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both\\\\nof them jump. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDUDLEY! Mr DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS\\\\nSNAKE! YOU WON\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99T BELIEVE WHAT IT\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99S DOING!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nDudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOut of the way, you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by\\\\nsurprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast\\\\nno one saw how it happened \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right\\\\nup close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.\\\\nHarry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s tank had\\\\nvanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the\\\\nfloor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the\\\\nexits.\\\\nAs the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing\\\\nvoice said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBrazil, here I come.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6 Thanksss, amigo.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe keeper of the reptile house was in shock.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut the glass,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he kept saying, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwhere did the glass go?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea\\\\nwhile he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As\\\\nfar as Harry had seen, the snake hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t done anything except snap playfully at\\\\ntheir heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s car,\\\\nDudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was\\\\nswearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least,\\\\nwas Piers calming down enough to say, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry was talking to it, weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you,\\\\nHarry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before\\\\nstarting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say,\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 cupboard \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 stay \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 no meals,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d before he collapsed into a chair, and\\\\nAunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.\\\\nHarry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nknow what time it was and he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet.\\\\nUntil they were, he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.\\\\nHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as\\\\nlong as he could remember, ever since he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been a baby and his parents had died\\\\nin that car crash. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t remember being in the car when his parents had\\\\ndied. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his\\\\ncupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a\\\\nburning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he\\\\ncouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t remember his\\\\nparents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was\\\\nforbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.\\\\nWhen he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some\\\\nunknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the\\\\nDursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that\\\\nstrangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were,\\\\ntoo. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping\\\\nwith Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man,\\\\nAunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wildlooking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus.\\\\nA bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street\\\\nthe other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all\\\\nthese people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a\\\\ncloser look.\\\\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gang hated\\\\nthat odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody\\\\nliked to disagree with Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gang.\\\\n\\\\nThe escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever\\\\npunishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer\\\\nholidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera,\\\\ncrashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike,\\\\nknocked down old Mrs Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.\\\\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\ngang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and\\\\nGordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of\\\\nthe lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in\\\\nDudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.\\\\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house,\\\\nwandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see\\\\na tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary\\\\nschool and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be with Dudley. Dudley had\\\\nbeen accepted at Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was\\\\ngoing there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local\\\\npublic school. Dudley thought this was very funny.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey stuff people\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he\\\\ntold Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWant to come upstairs and practice?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, thanks,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe poor toilet\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s never had anything as\\\\nhorrible as your head down it \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it might be sick.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Then he ran, before Dudley\\\\ncould work out what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d said.\\\\nOne day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his\\\\nSmeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs Figg\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. Mrs Figg wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t as bad as\\\\nusual. It turned out she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she\\\\ndidn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and\\\\ngave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had it for several\\\\nyears.\\\\nThat evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in\\\\nhis brand-new uniform. Smeltings\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange\\\\nknickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly\\\\nsticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t looking. This was\\\\nsupposed to be good training for later life.\\\\nAs he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said\\\\ngruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears\\\\nand said she couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so\\\\nhandsome and grown-up. Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t trust himself to speak. He thought two of\\\\nhis ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went\\\\nin for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He\\\\nwent to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in\\\\ngray water.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s this?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always\\\\ndid if he dared to ask a question.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour new school uniform,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said.\\\\nHarry looked in the bowl again.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t realize it had to be so wet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be stupid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d snapped Aunt Petunia. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m dyeing some of Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nold things gray for you. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll look just like everyone else\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s when I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve finished.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat\\\\ndown at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his\\\\nfirst day at Stonewall High \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin,\\\\nprobably.\\\\nDudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of\\\\nthe smell from Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as\\\\nusual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on\\\\nthe table.\\\\nThey heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGet the mail, Dudley,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMake Harry get it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGet the mail, Harry.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMake Dudley get it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPoke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things\\\\nlay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sister Marge, who was\\\\nvacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\na letter for Harry.\\\\nHarry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic\\\\nband. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no\\\\nfriends, no other relatives \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t belong to the library, so he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never even\\\\ngot rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so\\\\nplainly there could be no mistake:\\\\nMr H. Potter\\\\nThe Cupboard under the Stairs\\\\n4 Privet Drive\\\\nLittle Whinging\\\\nSurrey\\\\n\\\\nThe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the\\\\naddress was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.\\\\nTurning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax\\\\nseal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a\\\\nlarge letter H.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHurry up, boy!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are you\\\\ndoing, checking for letter bombs?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He chuckled at his own joke.\\\\nHarry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle\\\\nVernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow\\\\nenvelope.\\\\nUncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over\\\\nthe postcard.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMarge\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ill,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he informed Aunt Petunia. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAte a funny whelk.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDad!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dudley suddenly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDad, Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got something!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the\\\\nsame heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his\\\\nhand by Uncle Vernon.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mine!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, trying to snatch it back.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be writing to you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter\\\\nopen with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster\\\\nthan a set of traffic lights. And it didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop there. Within seconds it was the\\\\ngrayish white of old porridge.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cP-P-Petunia!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he gasped.\\\\nDudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high\\\\nout of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a\\\\nmoment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a\\\\nchoking noise.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVernon! Oh my goodness \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Vernon!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and\\\\nDudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t used to being ignored. He gave his\\\\nfather a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI want to read that letter,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said loudly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI want to read it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry furiously, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cas it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGet out, both of you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back\\\\ninside its envelope.\\\\nHarry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t move.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI WANT MY LETTER!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he shouted.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet me see it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d demanded Dudley.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOUT!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the\\\\nscruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door\\\\nbehind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who\\\\nwould listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from\\\\none ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVernon,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9clook at the\\\\naddress \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think\\\\nthey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re watching the house?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWatching \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 spying \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 might be following us,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d muttered Uncle Vernon\\\\nwildly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we\\\\ndon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry could see Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shiny black shoes pacing up and down\\\\nthe kitchen.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said finally. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll ignore it. If they don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get an answer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\nYes, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s best\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6we won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do anything\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t we swear when we\\\\ntook him in we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThat evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something\\\\nhe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s my letter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed\\\\nthrough the door. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s writing to me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo one. It was addressed to you by mistake,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon shortly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have burned it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was not a mistake,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry angrily, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit had my cupboard on it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSILENCE!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the\\\\nceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which\\\\nlooked quite painful.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 yes, Harry \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been\\\\nthinking\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re really getting a bit big for it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6we think it might be nice if you\\\\nmoved into Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s second bedroom.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ask questions!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d snapped his uncle. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTake this stuff upstairs, now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe Dursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt\\\\nPetunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sister, Marge), one where\\\\nDudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t fit\\\\ninto his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he\\\\nowned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared\\\\naround him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera\\\\nwas lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next\\\\ndoor neighbor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dog; in the corner was Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s first-ever television set, which\\\\nhe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there\\\\nwas a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at\\\\nschool for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because\\\\nDudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only\\\\nthings in the room that looked as though they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never been touched.\\\\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I\\\\ndon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want him in there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6I need that room\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6make him get out...\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have given\\\\nanything to be up here. Today he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter\\\\nthan up here without it.\\\\nNext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock.\\\\nHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on\\\\npurpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof,\\\\nand he still didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time\\\\nyesterday and bitterly wishing he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon\\\\nand Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.\\\\nWhen the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice\\\\nto Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his\\\\nSmelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s another one!\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Mr H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the\\\\nhall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground\\\\nto get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had\\\\ngrabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused\\\\nfighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon\\\\nstraightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s letter clutched in his hand.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo to your cupboard \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I mean, your bedroom,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he wheezed at Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDudley \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 go \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 just go.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had\\\\nmoved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t received his first\\\\nletter. Surely that meant they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d try again? And this time he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d make sure they\\\\ndidn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t fail. He had a plan.\\\\nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock the next morning. Harry turned\\\\nit off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t wake the Dursleys. He stole\\\\ndownstairs without turning on any of the lights.\\\\nHe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and\\\\nget the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the\\\\ndark hall toward the front door \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAAAAARRRGH!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry leapt into the air; he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d trodden on something big and squashy on\\\\nthe doormat \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 something alive!\\\\nLights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big,\\\\nsquashy something had been his uncle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the\\\\nfoot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do\\\\nexactly what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour\\\\nand then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into\\\\nthe kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle\\\\nVernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI want \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into\\\\npieces before his eyes.\\\\nUncle Vernon didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed\\\\nup the mail slot.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cif they\\\\ncan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t deliver them they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll just give up.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not sure that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll work, Vernon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, these people\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not like\\\\nyou and me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of\\\\nfruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.\\\\nOn Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go\\\\nthrough the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the\\\\nsides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs\\\\nbathroom.\\\\nUncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got\\\\nout a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back\\\\n\\\\ndoors so no one could go out. He hummed \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTiptoe Through the Tulips\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d as he\\\\nworked, and jumped at small noises.\\\\nOn Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry\\\\nfound their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two\\\\ndozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through\\\\nthe living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the\\\\npost office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia\\\\nshredded the letters in her food processor.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dudley asked Harry in\\\\namazement.\\\\n***\\\\nOn Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking\\\\ntired and rather ill, but happy.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo post on Sundays,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he reminded them cheerfully as he spread\\\\nmarmalade on his newspapers, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cno damn letters today \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nSomething came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and\\\\ncaught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters\\\\ncame pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry\\\\nleapt into the air trying to catch one \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOut! OUT!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nUncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall.\\\\nWhen Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces,\\\\nUncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming\\\\ninto the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat does it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling\\\\ngreat tufts out of his mustache at the same time. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI want you all back here in five\\\\nminutes ready to leave. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going away. Just pack some clothes. No\\\\narguments!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared\\\\nargue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up\\\\ndoors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in\\\\nthe back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he\\\\ntried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.\\\\nThey drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t dare ask where\\\\nthey were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and\\\\ndrive in the opposite direction for a while.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShake \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99em off\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6shake \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99em off,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he would mutter whenever he did this.\\\\nThey didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling.\\\\n\\\\nHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d missed five\\\\ntelevision programs he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d wanted to see, and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never gone so long without\\\\nblowing up an alien on his computer.\\\\nUncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the\\\\noutskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and\\\\ndamp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the\\\\nwindowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\nThey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the\\\\nnext day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their\\\\ntable.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Scuse me, but is one of you Mr H. Potter? Only I got about an \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99undred\\\\nof these at the front desk.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nShe held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:\\\\nMr H. Potter\\\\nRoom 17\\\\nRailview Hotel\\\\nCokeworth\\\\nHarry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of\\\\nthe way. The woman stared.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll take them,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following\\\\nher from the dining room.\\\\n***\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it be better just to go home, dear?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Aunt Petunia suggested\\\\ntimidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem to hear her. Exactly what he\\\\nwas looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest,\\\\ngot out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went\\\\nagain. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across\\\\na suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDaddy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone mad, hasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late\\\\nthat afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the\\\\ncar, and disappeared.\\\\nIt started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Monday,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he told his mother. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Great Humberto\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s on tonight. I\\\\nwant to stay somewhere with a television.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nMonday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and\\\\nyou could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of\\\\n\\\\ntelevision \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eleventh birthday. Of course,\\\\nhis birthdays were never exactly fun \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 last year, the Dursleys had given him a\\\\ncoat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s old socks. Still, you weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t eleven\\\\nevery day.\\\\nUncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long,\\\\nthin package and didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d bought.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFound the perfect place!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome on! Everyone out!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what\\\\nlooked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most\\\\nmiserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no\\\\ntelevision in there.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStorm forecast for tonight!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his\\\\nhands together. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd this gentleman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nA toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather\\\\nwicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve already got us some rations,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cso all aboard!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks\\\\nand a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they\\\\nreached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the\\\\nbroken-down house.\\\\nThe inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind\\\\nwhistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and\\\\nempty. There were only two rooms.\\\\nUncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four\\\\nbananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and\\\\nshriveled up.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCould do with some of those letters now, eh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said cheerfully.\\\\nHe was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a\\\\nchance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed,\\\\nthough the thought didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t cheer him up at all.\\\\nAs night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the\\\\nhigh waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy\\\\nwindows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and\\\\nmade up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went\\\\noff to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor\\\\nhe could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.\\\\nThe storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry\\\\ncouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his\\\\nstomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s snores were drowned by the low rolls\\\\n\\\\nof thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s watch, which\\\\nwas dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be eleven\\\\nin ten minutes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if\\\\nthe Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.\\\\nFive minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the\\\\nroof wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes\\\\nto go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got\\\\nback that he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be able to steal one somehow.\\\\nThree minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like\\\\nthat? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the\\\\nrock crumbling into the sea?\\\\nOne minute to go and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be eleven. Thirty seconds...twenty\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6ten\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\nnine \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 maybe he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 three\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6two\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6one\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\nBOOM.\\\\nThe whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door.\\\\nSomeone was outside, knocking to come in.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the cannon?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said stupidly.\\\\nThere was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the\\\\nroom. He was holding a rifle in his hands \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 now they knew what had been in the\\\\nlong, thin package he had brought with them.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he shouted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI warn you \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m armed!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThere was a pause. Then \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nSMASH!\\\\nThe door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and\\\\nwith a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.\\\\nA giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost\\\\ncompletely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but\\\\nyou could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.\\\\nThe giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just\\\\nbrushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back\\\\ninto its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look\\\\nat them all.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make us a cup o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 tea, could yeh? It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not been an easy journey.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBudge up, yeh great lump,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the stranger.\\\\nDudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching,\\\\nterrified, behind Uncle Vernon.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 here\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Harry!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the giant.\\\\nHarry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the\\\\nbeetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLas\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 time I saw you, you was only a baby,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the giant. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeh look a\\\\nlot like yer dad, but yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got yer mom\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nUncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI demand that you leave at once, sir!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are breaking and\\\\nentering!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the giant; he reached over\\\\n\\\\nthe back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hands, bent it into a\\\\nknot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the\\\\nroom.\\\\nUncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnyway \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Harry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ca\\\\nvery happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I mighta sat on it at\\\\nsome point, but it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll taste all right.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nFrom an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed\\\\nbox. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate\\\\ncake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.\\\\nHarry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words\\\\ngot lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho are you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe giant chuckled.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTrue, I haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and\\\\nGrounds at Hogwarts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe held out an enormous hand and shook Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s whole arm.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat about that tea then, eh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, rubbing his hands together. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d\\\\nnot say no ter summat stronger if yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got it, mind.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHis eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he\\\\nsnorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see what he was doing\\\\nbut when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the\\\\nwhole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him\\\\nas though he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d sunk into a hot bath.\\\\nThe giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and\\\\nbegan taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a\\\\nsquashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a\\\\nbottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea.\\\\nSoon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a\\\\nthing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly\\\\nburnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said\\\\nsharply, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe giant chuckled darkly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYer great puddin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 of a son don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 need fattenin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 anymore, Dursley, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nworry.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted\\\\nanything so wonderful, but he still couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as\\\\nnobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sorry, but I still don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nreally know who you are.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his\\\\n\\\\nhand.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCall me Hagrid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ceveryone does. An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 like I told yeh, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m\\\\nKeeper of Keys at Hogwarts \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll know all about Hogwarts, o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 course.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 no,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\nHagrid looked shocked.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSorry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry said quickly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSorry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank\\\\nback into the shadows. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t gettin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nyer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even know abou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Hogwarts, fer\\\\ncryin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cALL WHAT?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid thundered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow wait jus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 one second!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The\\\\nDursleys were cowering against the wall.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you mean ter tell me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he growled at the Dursleys, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat this boy \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nthis boy! \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 knows nothin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 abou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 about ANYTHING?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all,\\\\nand his marks weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t bad.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know some things,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can, you know, do math and stuff.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nBut Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbout our world, I mean.\\\\nYour world. My world. Yer parents\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 world.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat world?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHagrid looked as if he was about to explode.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDURSLEY!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he boomed.\\\\nUncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that\\\\nsounded like \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMimblewimble.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut yeh must know about yer mom and dad,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI mean, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re\\\\nfamous. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re famous.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat? My \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 my mom and dad weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t famous, were they?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeh don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 know...yeh don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 know....\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid ran his fingers through his\\\\nhair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeh don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 know what yeh are?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said finally.\\\\nUncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStop!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he commanded. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy\\\\nanything!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nA braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious\\\\nlook Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with\\\\nrage.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore\\\\n\\\\nleft fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve kept it\\\\nfrom him all these years?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKept what from me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry eagerly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSTOP! I FORBID YOU!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.\\\\nAunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 yer a\\\\nwizard.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThere was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind\\\\ncould be heard.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m a what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d gasped Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA wizard, o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 course,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which\\\\ngroaned and sank even lower, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 a thumpin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 good \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98un, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d say, once yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve\\\\nbeen trained up a bit. With a mum an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dad like yours, what else would yeh be?\\\\nAn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I reckon it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s abou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 time yeh read yer letter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope,\\\\naddressed in emerald green to Mr H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The\\\\nSea. He pulled out the letter and read:\\\\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\\\\nHeadmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\\\n(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme\\\\nMugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)\\\\nDear Mr Potter,\\\\nWe are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts\\\\nSchool of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary\\\\nbooks and equipment.\\\\nTerm begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.\\\\nYours sincerely,\\\\nMinerva McGonagall,\\\\nDeputy Headmistress\\\\nQuestions exploded inside Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head like fireworks and he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\ndecide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat does it\\\\nmean, they await my owl?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGallopin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Gorgons, that reminds me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, clapping a hand to\\\\nhis forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another\\\\n\\\\npocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 a real, live, rather ruffled-looking\\\\nowl \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth\\\\nhe scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:\\\\nDear Professor Dumbledore,\\\\nGiven Harry his letter.\\\\nTaking him to buy his things tomorrow.\\\\nWeather\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s horrible. Hope you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re well.\\\\nHagrid\\\\nHagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak,\\\\nwent to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and\\\\nsat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.\\\\nHarry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere was I?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still\\\\nashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not going,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said.\\\\nHagrid grunted.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, interested.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA Muggle,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what we call nonmagic folk like them.\\\\nAn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s your bad luck you grew up in a family o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the biggest Muggles I ever laid\\\\neyes on.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe swore when we took him in we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d put a stop to that rubbish,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\nUncle Vernon, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cswore we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou knew?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou knew I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m a \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 a wizard?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKnew!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKnew! Of course we knew!\\\\nHow could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter\\\\njust like that and disappeared off to that \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 that school \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and came home every\\\\nvacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the\\\\nonly one who saw her for what she was \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 a freak! But for my mother and\\\\nfather, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in\\\\nthe family!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nShe stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed\\\\nshe had been wanting to say all this for years.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had\\\\nyou, and of course I knew you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be just the same, just as strange, just as \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 as \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nabnormal \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we\\\\ngot landed with you!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHarry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said,\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBlown up? You told me they died in a car crash!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCAR CRASH!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys\\\\nscuttled back to their corner. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow could a car crash kill Lily an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 James Potter?\\\\nIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 his own story when every\\\\nkid in our world knows his name!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut why? What happened?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked urgently.\\\\nThe anger faded from Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face. He looked suddenly anxious.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI never expected this,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, in a low, worried voice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI had no idea,\\\\nwhen Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 hold of yeh, how much\\\\nyeh didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know. Ah, Harry, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 know if I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m the right person ter tell yeh \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nbut someone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gotta \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 yeh can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 mind, I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell\\\\nyeh everythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a great myst\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ry, parts of it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\nbegins, I suppose, with \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 with a person called \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 but it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s incredible yeh don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nknow his name, everyone in our world knows \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 like sayin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the name if I can help it. No one does.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy not?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGulpin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult.\\\\nSee, there was this wizard who went ...bad. As bad as you could go. Worse.\\\\nWorse than worse. His name was...\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHagrid gulped, but no words came out.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCould you write it down?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry suggested.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNah \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t spell it. All right \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Voldemort. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid shuddered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nmake me say it again. Anyway, this \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 this wizard, about twenty years ago now,\\\\nstarted lookin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fer followers. Got \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98em, too \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 some were afraid, some just\\\\nwanted a bit o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 his power, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98cause he was gettin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 himself power, all right. Dark\\\\ndays, Harry. Didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know who ter trust, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t dare get friendly with strange\\\\nwizards or witches\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6terrible things happened. He was takin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 over. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Course, some\\\\nstood up to him \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he killed \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98em. Horribly. One o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the only safe places left\\\\nwas Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid\\\\nof. Didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t dare try takin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the school, not jus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 then, anyway.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, yer mum an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dad were as good a witch an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 wizard as I ever knew.\\\\nHead boy an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ry is why YouKnow-Who never tried to get \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98em on his side before\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6probably knew they were\\\\ntoo close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ter do with the Dark Side.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMaybe he thought he could persuade \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98em...maybe he just wanted \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98em\\\\noutta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all\\\\nliving, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer\\\\nhouse an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew\\\\nhis nose with a sound like a foghorn.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSorry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that sad \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 knew yer mum an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dad, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 nicer\\\\npeople yeh couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t find \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 anyway\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou-Know-Who killed \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98em. An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 then \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 this is the real myst\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ry of\\\\nthe thing \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose,\\\\nor maybe he just liked killin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 by then. But he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do it. Never wondered\\\\nhow you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what\\\\nyeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 took care of yer mum an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dad\\\\nan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 yer house, even \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 but it didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t work on you, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why yer famous,\\\\nHarry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99em, no one except you, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nhe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d killed some o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the best witches an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 wizards of the age \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 the McKinnons,\\\\nthe Bones, the Prewetts \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you was only a baby, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you lived.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nSomething very painful was going on in Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mind. As Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s story\\\\ncame to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than\\\\nhe had ever remembered it before \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and he remembered something else, for the\\\\nfirst time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.\\\\nHagrid was watching him sadly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTook yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s orders.\\\\nBrought yeh ter this lot\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLoad of old tosh,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost\\\\nforgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have\\\\ngot back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, you listen here, boy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he snarled, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI accept there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s something\\\\nstrange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have cured \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and\\\\nas for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdoes, no denying it, and\\\\nthe world\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s better off without them in my opinion \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 asked for all they got,\\\\ngetting mixed up with these wizarding types \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 just what I expected, always\\\\nknew they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d come to a sticky end \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nBut at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink\\\\numbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he\\\\nsaid, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m warning you, Dursley \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m warning you \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 one more word\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIn danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant,\\\\nUncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and\\\\nfell silent.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s better,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on\\\\nthe sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.\\\\nHarry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what happened to Vol-, sorry \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I mean, You-Know-Who?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter\\\\nkill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the biggest myst\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ry, see\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6he was\\\\ngettin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 more an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 more powerful \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 why\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d he go?\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSome say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough\\\\nhuman left in him to die. Some say he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s still out there, bidin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 his time, like, but I\\\\ndon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98em\\\\ncame outta kinda trances. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 reckon they could\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve done if he was comin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nback.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMost of us reckon he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s still out there somewhere but lost his powers.\\\\nToo weak to carry on. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Cause somethin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 about you finished him, Harry. There\\\\nwas somethin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 goin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 on that night he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t counted on \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I dunno what it was,\\\\nno one does \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 but somethin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 about you stumped him, all right.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but\\\\nHarry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a\\\\nhorrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d spent his life\\\\nbeing clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he\\\\nwas really a wizard, why hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t they been turned into warty toads every time\\\\nthey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d once defeated the greatest\\\\nsorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him\\\\naround like a football?\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said quietly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think you must have made a mistake. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nthink I can be a wizard.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nTo his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or\\\\nangry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6every odd\\\\nthing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when\\\\nhe, Harry, had been upset or angry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6chased by Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gang, he had somehow\\\\nfound himself out of their reach\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6dreading going to school with that ridiculous\\\\nhaircut, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d managed to make it grow back...and the very last time Dudley had\\\\nhit him, hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it?\\\\nHadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he set a boa constrictor on him?\\\\nHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively\\\\nbeaming at him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry Potter, not a wizard \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 you wait, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be\\\\n\\\\nright famous at Hogwarts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nBut Uncle Vernon wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to give in without a fight.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHaven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t I told you he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not going?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he hissed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to Stonewall\\\\nHigh and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be grateful for it. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of\\\\nrubbish \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 spell books and wands and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop him,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d growled\\\\nHagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStop Lily an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 James Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s son goin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His\\\\nname\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s been down ever since he was born. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s off ter the finest school of\\\\nwitchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know\\\\nhimself. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be under\\\\nthe greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO\\\\nTEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d yelled Uncle Vernon.\\\\nBut he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it\\\\nover his head, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNEVER \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he thundered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 INSULT \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 ALBUS \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nDUMBLEDORE \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 IN \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 FRONT \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 OF \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 ME!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at\\\\nDudley \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp\\\\nsqueal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands\\\\nclasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them,\\\\nHarry saw a curly pig\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.\\\\nUncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other\\\\nroom, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind\\\\nthem.\\\\nHagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ta lost me temper,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said ruefully, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut it didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t work\\\\nanyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig\\\\nanyway there wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t much left ter do.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBe grateful if yeh didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 er \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99. I was allowed ter do a\\\\nbit ter follow yeh an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 get yer letters to yeh an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 stuff \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 one o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the reasons I was so\\\\nkeen ter take on the job.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you supposed to do magic?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, well \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I was at Hogwarts meself but I \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 er \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 got expelled, ter tell\\\\nyeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 everything.\\\\nBut Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy were you expelled?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gettin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 late and we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got lots ter do tomorrow,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid loudly.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGotta get up ter town, get all yer books an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 that.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can kip under that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 mind if it wriggles a bit, I think\\\\nI still got a couple o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 doormice in one o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the pockets.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHarry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight,\\\\nhe kept his eyes shut tight.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was a dream, he told himself firmly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI dreamed a giant called Hagrid\\\\ncame to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be\\\\nat home in my cupboard.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThere was suddenly a loud tapping noise.\\\\nAnd there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart\\\\nsinking. But he still didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream.\\\\nTap. Tap. Tap.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry mumbled, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m getting up.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe sat up and Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of\\\\nsunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa,\\\\nand there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its\\\\nbeak.\\\\nHarry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon\\\\nwas swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The\\\\nowl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t wake\\\\nup. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coat.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do that.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak\\\\nfiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry loudly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s an owl \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPay him,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid grunted into the sofa.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe wants payin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fer deliverin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the paper. Look in the pockets.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 bunches of\\\\nkeys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags...finally, Harry\\\\npulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGive him five Knuts,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid sleepily.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKnuts?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe little bronze ones.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so\\\\n\\\\nHarry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off\\\\nthrough the open window.\\\\nHagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBest be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 buy all\\\\nyer stuff fer school.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just\\\\nthought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him\\\\nhad got a puncture.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUm \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Hagrid?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMm?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got any money \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and you heard Uncle Vernon last night\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6he\\\\nwon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t pay for me to go and learn magic.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t worry about that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his\\\\nhead. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cD\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99yeh think yer parents didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t leave yeh anything?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut if their house was destroyed \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is\\\\nGringotts. Wizards\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 bank. Have a sausage, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not bad cold \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nsay no teh a bit o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 yer birthday cake, neither.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWizards have banks?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGoblins?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 so yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be mad ter try an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 rob it, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll tell yeh that. Never mess\\\\nwith goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh\\\\nwant ter keep safe \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fact, I gotta visit\\\\nGringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid drew himself\\\\nup proudly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\ngettin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 things from Gringotts \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 knows he can trust me, see.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGot everythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99? Come on, then.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now\\\\nand the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still\\\\nthere, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow did you get here?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked, looking around for another boat.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFlew,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFlew?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 but we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll go back in this. Not s\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99pposed ter use magic now I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve\\\\ngot yeh.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to\\\\nimagine him flying.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSeems a shame ter row, though,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, giving Harry another of\\\\nhis sideways looks. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf I was ter \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 er \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 speed things up a bit, would yeh mind\\\\nnot mentionin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 it at Hogwarts?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf course not,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out\\\\nthe pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off\\\\ntoward land.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSpells \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 enchantments,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he\\\\nspoke. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey say there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dragons guardin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the high security vaults. And then yeh\\\\ngotta find yer way \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep\\\\nunder the Underground. Yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d die of hunger tryin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ter get out, even if yeh did\\\\nmanage ter get yer hands on summat.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the\\\\nDaily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left\\\\nalone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never had so many\\\\nquestions in his life.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMinistry o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Magic messin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 things up as usual,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid muttered, turning\\\\nthe page.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a Ministry of Magic?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked, before he could stop\\\\nhimself.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Course,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\ncourse, but he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job.\\\\nBungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning,\\\\naskin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fer advice.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what does a Ministry of Magic do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s still\\\\nwitches an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 wizards up an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 down the country.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy? Blimey, Harry, everyone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be wantin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 magic solutions to their\\\\nproblems. Nah, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re best left alone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAt this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid\\\\nfolded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.\\\\nPassersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to\\\\nthe station. Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as\\\\nanyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and\\\\nsaying loudly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cdid you say\\\\nthere are dragons at Gringotts?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, so they say,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCrikey, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like a dragon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like one?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWanted one ever since I was a kid \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 here we go.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey had reached the station. There was a train to London in five\\\\nminutes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 time. Hagrid, who didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t understand \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMuggle money,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d as he called it,\\\\ngave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.\\\\nPeople stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and\\\\nsat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStill got yer letter, Harry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked as he counted stitches.\\\\nHarry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a list there of everything yeh need.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t noticed the night\\\\nbefore, and read:\\\\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL o f WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY\\\\nUNIFORM\\\\nFirst-year students will require:\\\\n1. Three sets of plain work robes (black)\\\\n2. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear\\\\n3. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar)\\\\n4.

Although Hagrid seemed to know\\\\nwhere he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary\\\\nway. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained\\\\nloudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know how the Muggles manage without magic,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said as they\\\\nclimbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.\\\\nHagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do\\\\nwas keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores,\\\\nhamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell\\\\nyou a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people.\\\\nCould there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there\\\\nreally shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some\\\\nhuge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t known that the\\\\nDursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even\\\\nthough everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nhelp trusting him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe Leaky Cauldron. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a\\\\nfamous place.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t pointed it out, Harry\\\\nwouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t glance at it.\\\\nTheir eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the\\\\nother as if they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the\\\\nmost peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could\\\\nmention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.\\\\nFor a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were\\\\nsitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a\\\\nlong pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was\\\\nquite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped\\\\nwhen they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled\\\\nat him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe usual, Hagrid?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, Tom, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m on Hogwarts business,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, clapping his great\\\\n\\\\nhand on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shoulder and making Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s knees buckle.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood Lord,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the bartender, peering at Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cis this \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 can this be\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBless my soul,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d whispered the old bartender, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6what an\\\\nhonor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his\\\\nhand, tears in his eyes.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWelcome back, Mr Potter, welcome back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old\\\\nwoman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid\\\\nwas beaming.\\\\nThen there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry\\\\nfound himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDoris Crockford, Mr Potter, can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m meeting you at last.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo proud, Mr Potter, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m just so proud.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAlways wanted to shake your hand \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m all of a flutter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDelighted, Mr Potter, just can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell you, Diggle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the name, Dedalus\\\\nDiggle.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve seen you before!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s top hat fell off in\\\\nhis excitement. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou bowed to me once in a shop.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe remembers!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid you hear that? He remembers me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry shook hands again and again \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nDoris Crockford kept coming back for more.\\\\nA pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his\\\\neyes was twitching.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProfessor Quirrell!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry, Professor Quirrell will be one\\\\nof your teachers at Hogwarts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cP-P-Potter,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cccan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cD-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d muttered Professor Quirrell, as\\\\nthough he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d rather not think about it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cN-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe laughed nervously. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve\\\\ng-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He looked terrified at\\\\nthe very thought.\\\\nBut the others wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It\\\\ntook almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to\\\\nmake himself heard over the babble.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMust get on \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nDoris Crockford shook Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them\\\\nthrough the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing\\\\nbut a trash can and a few weeds.\\\\nHagrid grinned at Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTold yeh, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell\\\\nwas tremblin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ter meet yeh \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 mind you, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s usually tremblin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs he always that nervous?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\noutta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience....They\\\\nsay he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 trouble with\\\\na hag \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own\\\\nsubject \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 now, where\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s me umbrella?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nVampires? Hags? Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was\\\\ncounting bricks in the wall above the trash can.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThree up\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6two across\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he muttered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRight, stand back, Harry.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.\\\\nThe brick he had touched quivered \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it wriggled \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 in the middle, a\\\\nsmall hole appeared \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it grew wider and wider \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 a second later they were\\\\nfacing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled\\\\nstreet that twisted and turned out of sight.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWelcome,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cto Diagon Alley.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe grinned at Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s amazement. They stepped through the archway.\\\\nHarry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly\\\\nback into solid wall.\\\\nThe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop.\\\\nCauldrons \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 All Sizes \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Self-Stirring \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nCollapsible, said a sign hanging over them.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be needin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 one,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut we gotta get yer money\\\\nfirst.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every\\\\ndirection as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the\\\\nshops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman\\\\noutside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDragon\\\\nliver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re mad.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nA low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops\\\\nOwl Emporium \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of\\\\nabout Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in\\\\nit. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry heard one of them say, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe new Nimbus Two Thousand \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\n\\\\nfastest ever \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and\\\\nstrange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with\\\\nbarrels of bat spleens and eels\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and\\\\nrolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGringotts,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid.\\\\nThey had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other\\\\nlittle shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of\\\\nscarlet and gold, was \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a goblin,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white\\\\nstone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had\\\\na swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and\\\\nfeet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of\\\\ndoors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:\\\\nEnter, stranger, but take heed\\\\nOf what awaits the sin of greed,\\\\nFor those who take, but do not earn,\\\\nMust pay most dearly in their turn.\\\\nSo if you seek beneath our floors\\\\nA treasure that was never yours,\\\\nThief, you have been warned, beware\\\\nOf finding more than treasure there.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLike I said, Yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be mad ter try an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 rob it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid.\\\\nA pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a\\\\nvast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools\\\\nbehind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales,\\\\nexamining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to\\\\ncount leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out\\\\nof these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMorning,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid to a free goblin. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve come ter take some\\\\nmoney outta Mr Harry Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s safe.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have his key, sir?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGot it here somewhere,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, and he started emptying his\\\\npockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the\\\\ngoblin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the\\\\ngoblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGot it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.\\\\nThe goblin looked at it closely.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat seems to be in order.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid\\\\nimportantly, throwing out his chest. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s about the You-Know-What in vault\\\\nseven hundred and thirteen.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe goblin read the letter carefully.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will have someone\\\\ntake you down to both vaults. Griphook!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nGriphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog\\\\nbiscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of\\\\nthe doors leading off the hall.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry asked.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell yeh that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid mysteriously. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery secret. Hogwarts\\\\nbusiness. Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s trusted me. More\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99n my job\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s worth ter tell yeh that.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nGriphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more\\\\nmarble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming\\\\ntorches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the\\\\nfloor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward\\\\nthem. They climbed in \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Hagrid with some difficulty \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and were off.\\\\nAt first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried\\\\nto remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible.\\\\nThe rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nsteering.\\\\nHarry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them\\\\nwide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and\\\\ntwisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 they plunged even\\\\ndeeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew\\\\nfrom the ceiling and floor.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI never know,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nthe difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStalagmite\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got an \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98m\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 in it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ask me questions\\\\njust now, I think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m gonna be sick.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small\\\\ndoor in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop\\\\nhis knees from trembling.\\\\nGriphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out,\\\\nand as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of\\\\nsilver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll yours,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d smiled Hagrid.\\\\nAll Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have known\\\\n\\\\nabout this or they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had\\\\nthey complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had\\\\nbeen a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.\\\\nHagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe gold ones are Galleons,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he explained. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSeventeen silver Sickles to\\\\na Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s easy enough. Right, that should\\\\nbe enough fer a couple o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 terms, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll keep the rest safe for yeh.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He turned to\\\\nGriphook. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more\\\\nslowly?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne speed only,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Griphook.\\\\nThey were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became\\\\ncolder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an\\\\nunderground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down\\\\nat the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his\\\\nneck.\\\\nVault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStand back,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently\\\\nwith one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be sucked through the\\\\ndoor and trapped in there,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Griphook.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow often do you check to see if anyone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s inside?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbout once every ten years,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.\\\\nSomething really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault,\\\\nHarry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels\\\\nat the very least \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby\\\\nlittle package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up\\\\nand tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew\\\\nbetter than to ask.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome on, back in this infernal cart, and don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t talk to me on the way\\\\nback, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s best if I keep me mouth shut,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid.\\\\nOne wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts.\\\\nHarry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He\\\\ndidn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he\\\\nwas holding more money than he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had in his whole life \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 more money than\\\\neven Dudley had ever had.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMight as well get yer uniform,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam\\\\nMalkin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Robes for All Occasions. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cListen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped\\\\noff fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He did\\\\n\\\\nstill look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shop alone, feeling\\\\nnervous.\\\\nMadam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHogwarts, dear?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said, when Harry started to speak. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGot the lot\\\\nhere \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIn the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a\\\\nfootstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin\\\\nstood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head, and began\\\\nto pin it to the right length.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHello,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the boy, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHogwarts, too?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s next door buying my books and mother\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s up the street\\\\nlooking at wands,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m\\\\ngoing to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see why first years can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nhave their own. I think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll bully father into getting me one and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll smuggle it in\\\\nsomehow.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry was strongly reminded of Dudley.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you got your own broom?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the boy went on.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPlay Quidditch at all?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Father says it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a crime if I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not picked to play for my house,\\\\nand I must say, I agree. Know what house you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be in yet?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll\\\\nbe in Slytherin, all our family have been \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think\\\\nI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d leave, wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMmm,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more\\\\ninteresting.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI say, look at that man!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front\\\\nwindow. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large\\\\nice creams to show he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t come in.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Hagrid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe works at Hogwarts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the boy, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve heard of him. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a sort of servant, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the gamekeeper,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less\\\\nevery second.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, exactly. I heard he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a sort of savage \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 lives in a hut on the school\\\\ngrounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up\\\\n\\\\nsetting fire to his bed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s brilliant,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry coldly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the boy, with a slight sneer. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy is he with you? Where\\\\nare your parents?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re dead,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry shortly. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel much like going into\\\\nthe matter with this boy.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, sorry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the other, not sounding sorry at all. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut they were our\\\\nkind, weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t they?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey were a witch and wizard, if that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what you mean.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI really don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re just\\\\nnot the same, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them\\\\nhave never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they\\\\nshould keep it in the old wizarding families. What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s your surname, anyway?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nBut before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s you done,\\\\nmy dear,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped\\\\ndown from the footstool.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the drawling boy.\\\\nHarry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him\\\\n(chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s up?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry\\\\ncheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote.\\\\nWhen they had left the shop, he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid, what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Quidditch?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBlimey, Harry, I keep forgettin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 how little yeh know \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 not knowin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nabout Quidditch!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make me feel worse,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale\\\\nboy in Madam Malkin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and he said people from Muggle families shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even be allowed\\\\nin \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYer not from a Muggle family. If he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d known who yeh were \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\ngrown up knowin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 yer name if his parents are wizardin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 folk. You saw what\\\\neveryone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what\\\\ndoes he know about it, some o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the best I ever saw were the only ones with\\\\nmagic in \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98em in a long line o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Muggles \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 look at yer mum! Look what she had\\\\nfer a sister!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo what is Quidditch?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s our sport. Wizard sport. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s like \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 like soccer in the Muggle world\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 everyone follows Quidditch \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 played up in the air on broomsticks and\\\\nthere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s four balls \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 sorta hard ter explain the rules.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSchool houses. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nduffers, but \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI bet I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m in Hufflepuff,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry gloomily.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBetter Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid darkly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not a\\\\nsingle witch or wizard who went bad who wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who\\\\nwas one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVol-, sorry \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYears an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 years ago,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid.\\\\nThey bought Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts\\\\nwhere the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving\\\\nstones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books\\\\nfull of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even\\\\nDudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on\\\\nsome of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and\\\\nCountercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the\\\\nLatest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More)\\\\nby Professor Vindictus Viridian.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not sayin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the\\\\nMuggle world except in very special circumstances,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 anyway,\\\\nyeh couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 work any of them curses yet, yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll need a lot more study before yeh\\\\nget ter that level.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHagrid wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt says\\\\npewter on yer list\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion\\\\ningredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary,\\\\nwhich was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad\\\\neggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs,\\\\ndried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of\\\\nfangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man\\\\nbehind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry\\\\nhimself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and\\\\nminuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).\\\\nOutside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s list again.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust yer wand left \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 A yeah, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I still haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got yeh a birthday\\\\npresent.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry felt himself go red.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have to. Tell yeh what, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get yer animal. Not a toad,\\\\n\\\\ntoads went outta fashion years ago, yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be laughed at \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 like cats,\\\\nthey make me sneeze. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re dead\\\\nuseful, carry yer mail an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 everythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nTwenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been\\\\ndark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a\\\\nlarge cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her\\\\nwing. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor\\\\nQuirrell.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 mention it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid gruffly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 expect you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had a lotta\\\\npresents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 only place fer wands,\\\\nOllivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nA magic wand\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.\\\\nThe last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door\\\\nread Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a\\\\nfaded purple cushion in the dusty window.\\\\nA tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped\\\\ninside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid\\\\nsat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library;\\\\nhe swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked\\\\ninstead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For\\\\nsome reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here\\\\nseemed to tingle with some secret magic.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood afternoon,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have\\\\njumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the\\\\nspindly chair.\\\\nAn old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like\\\\nmoons through the gloom of the shop.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHello,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry awkwardly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh yes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the man. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, yes. I thought I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be seeing you soon.\\\\nHarry Potter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a question. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have your mother\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes. It seems only\\\\nyesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter\\\\ninches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nMr Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink.\\\\nThose silvery eyes were a bit creepy.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven\\\\ninches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say\\\\nyour father favored it \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nMr Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to\\\\nnose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s where\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nMr Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s forehead with a\\\\nlong, white finger.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said softly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThirteenand-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong\\\\nhands\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6well, if I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d known what that wand was going out into the world to do.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe shook his head and then, to Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s relief, spotted Hagrid.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6Oak, sixteen\\\\ninches, rather bendy, wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was, sir, yes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you\\\\ngot expelled?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mr Ollivander, suddenly stern.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 yes, they did, yes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve still got\\\\nthe pieces, though,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he added brightly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t use them?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mr Ollivander sharply.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, no, sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink\\\\numbrella very tightly as he spoke.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHmmm,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mr Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell,\\\\nnow \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Mr Potter. Let me see.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He pulled a long tape measure with silver\\\\nmarkings out of his pocket. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhich is your wand arm?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 well, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m right-handed,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHold out your arm. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He measured Harry from shoulder to\\\\nfinger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head.\\\\nAs he measured, he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEvery Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful\\\\nmagical substance, Mr Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and\\\\nthe heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no\\\\ntwo unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will\\\\nnever get such good results with another wizard\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wand.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring\\\\nbetween his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr Ollivander was flitting\\\\naround the shelves, taking down boxes.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat will do,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the\\\\nfloor. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRight then, Mr Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring.\\\\nNine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr\\\\nOllivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMaple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry tried \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was\\\\n\\\\nsnatched back by Mr Ollivander.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy.\\\\nGo on, go on, try it out.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr Ollivander was waiting\\\\nfor. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair,\\\\nbut the more wands Mr Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he\\\\nseemed to become.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll find the perfect match here\\\\nsomewhere \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I wonder, now \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 yes, why not \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 unusual combination \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 holly\\\\nand phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised\\\\nthe wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a\\\\nstream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing\\\\ndancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr\\\\nOllivander cried, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6how\\\\ncurious\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6how very curious\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe put Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper,\\\\nstill muttering, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCurious\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6curious\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSorry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s curious?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nMr Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI remember every wand I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve ever sold, Mr Potter. Every single wand. It\\\\nso happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another\\\\nfeather \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for\\\\nthis wand when its brother \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 why, its brother gave you that scar.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry swallowed.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things\\\\nhappen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6I think we must expect great\\\\nthings from you, Mr Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great\\\\nthings \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 terrible, yes, but great.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry shivered. He wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sure he liked Mr Ollivander too much. He\\\\npaid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr Ollivander bowed them from his\\\\nshop.\\\\nThe late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their\\\\nway back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky\\\\nCauldron, now empty. Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak at all as they walked down the road; he\\\\ndidn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground,\\\\nladen as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl\\\\nasleep in its cage on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington\\\\n\\\\nstation; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the\\\\nshoulder.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGot time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said.\\\\nHe bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat\\\\nthem. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid.\\\\nHarry wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sure he could explain. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just had the best birthday of his\\\\nlife \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and yet \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEveryone thinks I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m special,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said at last. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll those people in the\\\\nLeaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr Ollivander\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6but I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know anything\\\\nabout magic at all. How can they expect great things? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m famous and I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\neven remember what I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m famous for. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what happened when Vol-,\\\\nsorry \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I mean, the night my parents died.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he\\\\nwore a very kind smile.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you worry, Harry. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the\\\\nbeginning at Hogwarts, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hard.\\\\nYeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been singled out, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s always hard. But yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have a great time at\\\\nHogwarts \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I did \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 still do, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99smatter of fact.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the\\\\nDursleys, then handed him an envelope.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYer ticket fer Hogwarts, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFirst o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 September \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 King\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Cross\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with\\\\nyer owl, she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll know where to find me\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.See yeh soon, Harry.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he\\\\nwas out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but\\\\nhe blinked and Hagrid had gone.\\\\n\\\\nHarry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s last month with the Dursleys wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t fun. True, Dudley was now so\\\\nscared of Harry he wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and\\\\nUncle Vernon didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or\\\\nshout at him \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 in fact, they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half\\\\nfurious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although\\\\nthis was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a\\\\nwhile.\\\\nHarry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to\\\\ncall her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books\\\\nwere very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig\\\\nswooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt\\\\nPetunia didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back\\\\ndead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on\\\\nthe piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the\\\\nfirst.\\\\nOn the last day of August he thought he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better speak to his aunt and\\\\nuncle about getting to King\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the\\\\nliving room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his\\\\nthroat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the\\\\nroom.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Uncle Vernon?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nUncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I need to be at King\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Cross tomorrow to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 to go to Hogwarts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nUncle Vernon grunted again.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWould it be all right if you gave me a lift?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nGrunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFunny way to get to a wizards\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 school, the train. Magic carpets all got\\\\npunctures, have they?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say anything.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere is this school, anyway?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the\\\\nticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven\\\\no\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he read.\\\\nHis aunt and uncle stared.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPlatform what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNine and three-quarters.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t talk rubbish,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is no platform nine and\\\\nthree-quarters.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s on my ticket.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBarking,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9chowling mad, the lot of them. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll see.\\\\nYou just wait. All right, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll take you to King\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Cross. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going up to\\\\nLondon tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t bother.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy are you going to London?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked, trying to keep things\\\\nfriendly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTaking Dudley to the hospital,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d growled Uncle Vernon. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGot to have\\\\nthat ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry woke at five o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock the next morning and was too excited and\\\\nnervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nwant to walk into the station in his wizard\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s robes \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d change on the train.\\\\nHe checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he\\\\nneeded, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room,\\\\nwaiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s huge, heavy trunk\\\\nhad been loaded into the Dursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into\\\\nsitting next to Harry, and they had set off.\\\\nThey reached King\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped\\\\nHarry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought\\\\nthis was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms\\\\nwith a nasty grin on his face.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, there you are, boy. Platform nine \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 platform ten. Your platform\\\\nshould be somewhere in the middle, but they don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem to have built it yet, do\\\\nthey?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over\\\\none platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the\\\\nmiddle, nothing at all.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave a good term,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He\\\\nleft without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All\\\\nthree of them were laughing. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was\\\\n\\\\nhe going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of\\\\nHedwig. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have to ask someone.\\\\nHe stopped a passing guard, but didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t dare mention platform nine and\\\\nthree-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\neven tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as\\\\nthough Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for\\\\nthe train that left at eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock, but the guard said there wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t one. In the\\\\nend the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying\\\\nhard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten\\\\nminutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he\\\\nwas stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket\\\\nfull of wizard money, and a large owl.\\\\nHagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like\\\\ntapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he\\\\nshould get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s stand between\\\\nplatforms nine and ten.\\\\nAt that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a\\\\nfew words of what they were saying.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 packed with Muggles, of course \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to\\\\nfour boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like\\\\nHarry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s in front of him \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and they had an owl.\\\\nHeart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so\\\\ndid he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the platform number?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the boys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 mother.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNine and three-quarters!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was\\\\nholding her hand, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMom, can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t I go\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go\\\\nfirst.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nWhat looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten.\\\\nHarry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 but just as the boy\\\\nreached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists\\\\ncame swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared\\\\naway, the boy had vanished.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFred, you next,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the plump woman said.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not Fred, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m George,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the boy. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHonestly, woman, you call\\\\nyourself our mother? Can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you tell I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m George?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSorry, George, dear.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOnly joking, I am Fred,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the boy, and off he went. His twin called\\\\n\\\\nafter him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had\\\\ngone \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 but how had he done it?\\\\nNow the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was\\\\nalmost there \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and then, quite suddenly, he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t anywhere.\\\\nThere was nothing else for it.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExcuse me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry said to the plump woman.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHello, dear,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFirst time at Hogwarts? Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s new, too.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nShe pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and\\\\ngangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe thing is \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 the thing is, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know how to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow to get onto the platform?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said kindly, and Harry nodded.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot to worry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll you have to do is walk straight at the\\\\nbarrier between platforms nine and ten. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop and don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be scared you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll\\\\ncrash into it, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re nervous.\\\\nGo on, go now before Ron.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 okay,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\nHe pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very\\\\nsolid.\\\\nHe started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms\\\\nnine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that\\\\nbarrier and then he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be in trouble \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a\\\\nheavy run \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 the barrier was coming nearer and nearer \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be able to\\\\nstop \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 the cart was out of control \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he was a foot away \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he closed his eyes\\\\nready for the crash \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nIt didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t come\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6he kept on running\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam\\\\nengine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said\\\\nHogwarts\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Express, eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a\\\\nwrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine\\\\nand Three-Quarters on it, He had done it.\\\\nSmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd,\\\\nwhile cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted\\\\nto one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of\\\\nheavy trunks.\\\\nThe first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging\\\\nout of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry\\\\npushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a\\\\nround-faced boy who was saying, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGran, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve lost my toad again.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, Neville,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he heard the old woman sigh.\\\\nA boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGive us a look, Lee, go on.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him\\\\nshrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.\\\\nHarry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty\\\\ncompartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then\\\\nstarted to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up\\\\nthe steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his\\\\nfoot.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWant a hand?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It was one of the red-haired twins he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d followed through\\\\nthe barrier.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, please,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry panted.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOy, Fred! C\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99mere and help!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nWith the twins\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 help, Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of\\\\nthe compartment.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThanks,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nlightning scar.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBlimey,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the other twin. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre you \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the first twin. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he added to Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry Potter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d chorused the twins.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, him,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI mean, yes, I am.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to\\\\nhis relief, a voice came floating in through the train\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s open door.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFred? George? Are you there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cComing, Mom.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nWith a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.\\\\nHarry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch\\\\nthe red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their\\\\nmother had just taken out her handkerchief.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRon, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got something on your nose.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and\\\\nbegan rubbing the end of his nose.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMom \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 geroff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He wriggled free.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said one of the\\\\ntwins.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShut up,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Percy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said their mother.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coming now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his\\\\nbillowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his\\\\nchest with the letter P on it.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stay long, Mother,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m up front, the prefects have got\\\\ntwo compartments to themselves \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, are you a prefect, Percy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said one of the twins, with an air of great\\\\nsurprise. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou should have said something, we had no idea.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the\\\\nother twin. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOnce \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOr twice \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA minute \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll summer \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, shut up,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Percy the Prefect.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow come Percy gets new robes, anyway?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said one of the twins.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBecause he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a prefect,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said their mother fondly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right, dear, well,\\\\nhave a good term \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 send me an owl when you get there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nShe kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, you two \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more\\\\nowl telling me you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve blown up a toilet or \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBlown up a toilet? We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never blown up a toilet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGreat idea though, thanks, Mom.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not funny. And look after Ron.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShut up,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and\\\\nhis nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry leaned back quickly so they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see him looking.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know\\\\nwho he is?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry Potter!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry heard the little girl\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please....\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t something you\\\\ngoggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAsked him. Saw his scar. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really there \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 like lightning.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPoor dear \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so\\\\npolite when he asked how to get onto the platform.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who\\\\n\\\\nlooks like?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nTheir mother suddenly became very stern.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you dare. As though he needs\\\\nreminding of that on his first day at school.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right, keep your hair on.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nA whistle sounded.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHurry up!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the\\\\ntrain. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their\\\\nyounger sister began to cry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, Ginny, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll send you loads of owls.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll send you a Hogwarts\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 toilet seat.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGeorge!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOnly joking, Mom.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe train began to move. Harry saw the boys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 mother waving and their\\\\nsister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it\\\\ngathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.\\\\nHarry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the\\\\ncorner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He\\\\ndidn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what he was going to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 but it had to be better than what he was\\\\nleaving behind.\\\\nThe door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy\\\\ncame in.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnyone sitting there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEverywhere else is full.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and\\\\nthen looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t looked. Harry saw\\\\nhe still had a black mark on his nose.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHey, Ron.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe twins were back.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cListen, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going down the middle of the train \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Lee Jordan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got a\\\\ngiant tarantula down there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRight,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d mumbled Ron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the other twin, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cdid we introduce ourselves? Fred and\\\\nGeorge Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBye,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut\\\\nbehind them.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre you really Harry Potter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron blurted out.\\\\nHarry nodded.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s jokes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\n\\\\nRon. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd have you really got \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 you know\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe pointed at Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s forehead.\\\\nHarry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s where You-Know-Who \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t remember it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron eagerly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWow,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as\\\\nthough he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the\\\\nwindow again.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre all your family wizards?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Harry, who found Ron just as\\\\ninteresting as Ron found him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Yes, I think so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think Mom\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got a second cousin\\\\nwho\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s an accountant, but we never talk about him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo you must know loads of magic already.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale\\\\nboy in Diagon Alley had talked about.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI heard you went to live with Muggles,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are they like?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHorrible \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are,\\\\nthough. Wish I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had three wizard brothers.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFive,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m the\\\\nsixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got a lot to live up to.\\\\nBill and Charlie have already left \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain\\\\nof Quidditch. Now Percy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but\\\\nthey still get really good marks and everyone thinks they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re really funny.\\\\nEveryone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no big deal,\\\\nbecause they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers.\\\\nI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got Bill\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s old robes, Charlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s old wand, and Percy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s old rat.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was\\\\nasleep.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHis name\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Scabbers and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy\\\\ngot an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t aff \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I\\\\nmean, I got Scabbers instead.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ears went pink. He seemed to think he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d said too much, because he\\\\nwent back to staring out of the window.\\\\nHarry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think there was anything wrong with not being able to\\\\nafford an owl. After all, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never had any money in his life until a month ago,\\\\nand he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s old clothes and never\\\\ngetting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6and until Hagrid told me, I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know anything about being a\\\\nwizard or about my parents or Voldemort \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon gasped.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou said You-Know-Who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, sounding both shocked\\\\nand impressed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have thought you, of all people \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\njust never knew you shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. See what I mean? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got loads to learn.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6I bet,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nhe added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot\\\\nlately, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI bet I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m the worst in the class.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s loads of people who come from Muggle families\\\\nand they learn quick enough.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nWhile they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London.\\\\nNow they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for\\\\na time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.\\\\nAround half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the\\\\ncorridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnything\\\\noff the cart, dears?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry, who hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ears\\\\nwent pink again and he muttered that he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d brought sandwiches. Harry went out\\\\ninto the corridor.\\\\nHe had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that\\\\nhe had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars\\\\nBars as he could carry \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 but the woman didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have Mars Bars. What she did\\\\nhave were Bettie Bott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Best Blowing Gum,\\\\nChocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a\\\\nnumber of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to\\\\nmiss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver\\\\nSickles and seven bronze Knuts.\\\\nRon stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped\\\\nit onto an empty seat.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHungry, are you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStarving,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.\\\\nRon had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four\\\\nsandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe always forgets I\\\\ndon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t like corned beef..\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSwap you for one of these,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, holding up a pasty. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo on \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want this, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all dry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe hasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got much time,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nhe added quickly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou know, with five of us.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo on, have a pasty,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, who had never had anything to share\\\\nbefore or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with\\\\nRon, eating their way through all Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pasties, cakes, and candies (the\\\\nsandwiches lay forgotten).\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are these?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate\\\\nFrogs. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not really frogs, are they?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He was starting to feel that nothing\\\\nwould surprise him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut see what the card is. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m missing Agrippa.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, of course, you wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Chocolate Frogs have cards,\\\\ninside them, you know, to collect \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 famous witches and wizards. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got about\\\\nfive hundred, but I haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a\\\\nman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing\\\\nsilver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus\\\\nDumbledore.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo this is Dumbledore!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell me you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never heard of Dumbledore!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan I have\\\\na frog? I might get Agrippa \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 thanks \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry turned over his card and read:\\\\nALBUS DUMBLEDORE\\\\nCURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS\\\\nC onsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is\\\\nparticularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for\\\\nthe discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s blood, and his work on alchemy\\\\nwith his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music\\\\nand tenpin bowling.\\\\nHarry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that\\\\nDumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face had disappeared.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t expect him to hang around all day,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be\\\\nback. No, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got Morgana again and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got about six of her\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6do you want it?\\\\nYou can start collecting.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be\\\\nunwrapped.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHelp yourself,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut in, you know, the Muggle world,\\\\n\\\\npeople just stay put in photos.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo they? What, they don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t move at all?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron sounded amazed.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWeird!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and\\\\ngave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking\\\\nat the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t keep his eyes off\\\\nthem. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of\\\\nWoodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his\\\\neyes away from the Druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a\\\\nbag of Bertie Bott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Every Flavor Beans.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou want to be careful with those,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron warned Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen they say\\\\nevery flavor, they mean every flavor \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 you know, you get all the ordinary ones\\\\nlike chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and\\\\nliver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBleaaargh \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 see? Sprouts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast,\\\\ncoconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even\\\\nbrave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t touch, which\\\\nturned out to be pepper.\\\\nThe countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The\\\\nneat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green\\\\nhills.\\\\nThere was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced\\\\nboy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked\\\\ntearful.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSorry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut have you seen a toad at all?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nWhen they shook their heads, he wailed, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve lost him! He keeps getting\\\\naway from me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll turn up,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the boy miserably. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, if you see him\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe left.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know why he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s so bothered,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d brought a toad I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d\\\\nlose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t talk.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe rat was still snoozing on Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lap.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe might have died and you wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know the difference,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron in\\\\ndisgust. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but\\\\nthe spell didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t work. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll show you, look\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking\\\\n\\\\nwand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUnicorn hair\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nearly poking out. Anyway \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again.\\\\nThe toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already\\\\nwearing her new Hogwarts robes.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHas anyone seen a toad? Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lost one,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. She had a bossy\\\\nsort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve already told him we haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seen it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, but the girl\\\\nwasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, are you doing magic? Let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s see it, then.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nShe sat down. Ron looked taken aback.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 all right.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe cleared his throat.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSunshine, daisies, butter mellow,\\\\nTurn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast\\\\nasleep.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre you sure that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a real spell?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the girl. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not very good,\\\\nis it? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all worked for me.\\\\nNobody in my family\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my\\\\nletter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the very best school of\\\\nwitchcraft there is, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve heard \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve learned all our course books by heart, of\\\\ncourse, I just hope it will be enough \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m Hermione Granger, by the way, who\\\\nare you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nShe said all this very fast.\\\\nHarry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he\\\\nhadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t learned all the course books by heart either.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m Ron Weasley,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron muttered.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry Potter,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre you really?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know all about you, of course \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I\\\\ngot a few extra books, for background reading, and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re in Modern Magical\\\\nHistory and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of\\\\nthe Twentieth Century.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAm I?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, feeling dazed.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGoodness, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you know, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have found out everything I could if it\\\\nwas me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo either of you know what house you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be in? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve\\\\nbeen asking around, and I hope I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I\\\\n\\\\nhear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be too\\\\nbad....Anyway, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better go and look for Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s toad. You two had better\\\\nchange, you know, I expect we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be there soon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAnd she left, taking the toadless boy with her.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhatever house I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m in, I hope she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not in it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. He threw his\\\\nwand back into his trunk. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStupid spell \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 George gave it to me, bet he knew it\\\\nwas a dud.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat house are your brothers in?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGryffindor,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMom and Dad were in it, too. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll say if I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nsuppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou know, I think the ends of Scabbers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 whiskers are a bit lighter,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\nHarry, trying to take Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mind off houses. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo what do your oldest brothers do\\\\nnow that they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve left, anyway?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry was wondering what a wizard did once he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d finished school.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCharlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s in Africa doing\\\\nsomething for Gringotts,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid you hear about Gringotts? It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s been all\\\\nover the Daily Prophet, but I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t suppose you get that with the Muggles \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nsomeone tried to rob a high security vault.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry stared.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cReally? What happened to them?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s such big news. They haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been caught. My\\\\ndad says it must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they\\\\ndon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think they took anything, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s odd. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Course, everyone gets scared\\\\nwhen something like this happens in case You-Know-Who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s behind it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle\\\\nof fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all\\\\npart of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVoldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d without worrying.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s your Quidditch team?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron asked.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know any.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry confessed.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron looked dumbfounded. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, you wait, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the best game in\\\\nthe world \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the\\\\npositions of the seven players, describing famous games he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been to with his\\\\nbrothers and the broomstick he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like to get if he had the money. He was just\\\\ntaking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door\\\\nslid open yet again, but it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger\\\\n\\\\nthis time.\\\\nThree boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was\\\\nthe pale boy from Madam Malkin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a\\\\nlot more interest than he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d shown back in Diagon Alley.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs it true?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re saying all down the train that Harry\\\\nPotter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s in this compartment. So it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s you, is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were\\\\nthickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they\\\\nlooked like bodyguards.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the pale boy carelessly,\\\\nnoticing where Harry was looking. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd my name\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco\\\\nMalfoy looked at him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThink my name\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My\\\\nfather told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than\\\\nthey can afford.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe turned back to Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll soon find out some wizarding families\\\\nare much better than others, Potter. You don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to go making friends with the\\\\nwrong sort. I can help you there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe held out his hand to shake Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, but Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t take it.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said\\\\ncoolly.\\\\nDraco Malfoy didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be careful if I were you, Potter,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said slowly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUnless you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re a bit\\\\npoliter you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll go the same way as your parents. They didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what was good\\\\nfor them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid,\\\\nand it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll rub off on you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nBoth Harry and Ron stood up.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSay that again,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron said, his face as red as his hair.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to fight us, are you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Malfoy sneered.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUnless you get out now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because\\\\nCrabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut we don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve eaten all our food\\\\nand you still seem to have some.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nGoyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Ron leapt\\\\nforward, but before he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.\\\\nScabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep\\\\ninto Goyle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s knuckle \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung\\\\nScabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit\\\\n\\\\nthe window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there\\\\nwere more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d heard footsteps,\\\\nbecause a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat has been going on?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said, looking at the sweets all over the\\\\nfloor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s been knocked out,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at\\\\nScabbers. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe it \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone back to sleep.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAnd so he had.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve met Malfoy before?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve heard of his family,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron darkly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey were some of the first\\\\nto come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been\\\\nbewitched. My dad doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe it. He says Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s father didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t need an\\\\nexcuse to go over to the Dark Side.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He turned to Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan we help you\\\\nwith something?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better hurry up and put your robes on, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve just been up to the\\\\nfront to ask the conductor, and he says we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re nearly there. You haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been\\\\nfighting, have you? You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be in trouble before we even get there!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cScabbers has been fighting, not us,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, scowling at her. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWould\\\\nyou mind leaving while we change?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I only came in here because people outside are behaving\\\\nvery childishly, racing up and down the corridors,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione in a sniffy\\\\nvoice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was\\\\ngetting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The\\\\ntrain did seem to be slowing down.\\\\nHe and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes.\\\\nRon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.\\\\nA voice echoed through the train: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe will be reaching Hogwarts in five\\\\nminutes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the\\\\nschool separately.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under\\\\nhis freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined\\\\nthe crowd thronging the corridor.\\\\nThe train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their\\\\nway toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the\\\\ncold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and\\\\nHarry heard a familiar voice: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFirs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 years! Firs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 years over here! All right there,\\\\nHarry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nHagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cC\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99mon, follow me \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 any more firs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 years? Mind yer step, now! Firs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nyears follow me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nSlipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a\\\\nsteep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there\\\\nmust be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing\\\\nhis toad, sniffed once or twice.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get yer firs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 sight o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Hogwarts in a sec,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid called over his\\\\nshoulder, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cjus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 round this bend here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThere was a loud \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOooooh!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black\\\\nlake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in\\\\nthe starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo more\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99n four to a boat!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little\\\\nboats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their\\\\nboat by Neville and Hermione.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEveryone in?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRight then\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 FORWARD!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAnd the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake,\\\\nwhich was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle\\\\noverhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on\\\\nwhich it stood.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHeads down!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all\\\\nbent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid\\\\na wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which\\\\nseemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind\\\\nof underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOy, you there! Is this your toad?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, who was checking the\\\\nboats as people climbed out of them.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTrevor!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they\\\\nclambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lamp, coming out at last\\\\nonto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.\\\\nThey walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak\\\\nfront door.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEveryone here? You there, still got yer toad?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.\\\\n\\\\nThe door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green\\\\nrobes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s first thought was that\\\\nthis was not someone to cross.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe firs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 years, Professor McGonagall,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nShe pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit\\\\nthe whole of the Dursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming\\\\ntorches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a\\\\nmagnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.\\\\nThey followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor.\\\\nHarry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nthe rest of the school must already be here \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 but Professor McGonagall showed\\\\nthe first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in,\\\\nstanding rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about\\\\nnervously.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWelcome to Hogwarts,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe start-of-term\\\\nbanquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you\\\\nwill be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony\\\\nbecause, while you are here, your house will be something like your family\\\\nwithin Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your\\\\nhouse dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and\\\\nSlytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced\\\\noutstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will\\\\nearn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end\\\\nof the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great\\\\nhonor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the\\\\nrest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can\\\\nwhile you are waiting.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cloak, which was fastened\\\\nunder his left ear, and on Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten\\\\n\\\\nhis hair.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall return when we are ready for you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPlease wait quietly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nShe left the chamber. Harry swallowed.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow exactly do they sort us into houses?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked Ron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSome sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was\\\\njoking.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school?\\\\nBut he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know any magic yet \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94what on earth would he have to do? He\\\\nhadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around\\\\nanxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking\\\\nmuch except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the\\\\nspells she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d learned and wondering which one she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d need. Harry tried hard not\\\\nto listen to her. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never been more nervous, never, not even when he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had to\\\\ntake a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d somehow turned his\\\\nteacher\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now,\\\\nProfessor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.\\\\nThen something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nseveral people behind him screamed.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just\\\\nstreamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they\\\\nglided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first\\\\nyears. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying:\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cForgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear Friar, haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He\\\\ngives us all a bad name and you know, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not really even a ghost \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I say, what\\\\nare you all doing here?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nA ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.\\\\nNobody answered.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNew students!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbout to be\\\\nSorted, I suppose?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nA few people nodded mutely.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHope to see you in Hufflepuff!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the Friar. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy old house, you\\\\nknow.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMove along now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said a sharp voice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Sorting Ceremony\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s about\\\\nto start.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nProfessor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away\\\\nthrough the opposite wall.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, form a line,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Professor McGonagall told the first years, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand\\\\nfollow me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nFeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line\\\\nbehind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the\\\\nchamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great\\\\nHall.\\\\nHarry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was\\\\nlit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four\\\\nlong tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid\\\\nwith glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long\\\\ntable where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years\\\\nup here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the\\\\nteachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale\\\\nlanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students,\\\\nthe ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked\\\\nupward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione\\\\nwhisper, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIts bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts,\\\\nA History.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great\\\\nHall didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t simply open on to the heavens.\\\\nHarry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently\\\\nplaced a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a\\\\npointed wizard\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt\\\\nPetunia wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have let it in the house.\\\\nMaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly,\\\\nthat seemed the sort of thing \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 noticing that everyone in the hall was now\\\\nstaring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete\\\\nsilence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nand the hat began to sing:\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, you may not think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m pretty,\\\\nBut don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t judge on what you see,\\\\nI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll eat myself if you can find\\\\nA smarter hat than me.\\\\nYou can keep your bowlers black,\\\\nYour top hats sleek and tall,\\\\nFor I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\\\\nAnd I can cap them all.\\\\nThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothing hidden in your head\\\\n\\\\nThe Sorting Hat can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see,\\\\nSo try me on and I will tell you\\\\nWhere you ought to be.\\\\nYou might belong in Gryffindor,\\\\nWhere dwell the brave at heart,\\\\nTheir daring, nerve, and chivalry\\\\nSet Gryffindors apart;\\\\nYou might belong in Hufflepuff,\\\\nWhere they are just and loyal,\\\\nThose patient Hufflepuffs are true\\\\nAnd unafraid of toil;\\\\nOr yet in wise old Ravenclaw,\\\\nif you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve a ready mind,\\\\nWhere those of wit and learning,\\\\nWill always find their kind;\\\\nOr perhaps in Slytherin\\\\nYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll make your real friends,\\\\nThose cunning folk use any means\\\\nTo achieve their ends.\\\\nSo put me on! Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be afraid!\\\\nAnd don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get in a flap!\\\\nYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re in safe hands (though I have none)\\\\nFor I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m a Thinking Cap!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to\\\\neach of the four tables and then became quite still again.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve just got to try on the hat!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron whispered to Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll kill\\\\nFred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having\\\\nto do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone\\\\nwatching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel brave or\\\\nquick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house\\\\nfor people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.\\\\nProfessor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of\\\\nparchment.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be\\\\nsorted,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbbott, Hannah!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nA pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the\\\\nhat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHUFFLEPUFF!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shouted the hat.\\\\nThe table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at\\\\nthe Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBones, Susan!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHUFFLEPUFF!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit\\\\nnext to Hannah.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBoot, Terry!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRAVENCLAW!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws\\\\nstood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBrocklehurst, Mandy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d went to Ravenclaw too, but \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBrown, Lavender\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nbecame the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with\\\\ncheers; Harry could see Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s twin brothers catcalling.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBulstrode, Millicent\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nimagination, after all he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like\\\\nan unpleasant lot.\\\\nHe was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked\\\\nfor teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen,\\\\nnot because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they\\\\nliked him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFinch-Fletchley, Justin!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHUFFLEPUFF!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nSometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at\\\\nothers it took a little while to decide. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFinnigan, Seamus,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the sandy-haired boy\\\\nnext to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the\\\\nhat declared him a Gryffindor.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGranger, Hermione!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHer\\\\nmione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her\\\\nhead.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGRYFFINDOR!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shouted the hat. Ron groaned.\\\\nA horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when\\\\nyou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re very nervous. What if he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t chosen at all? What if he just sat there\\\\nwith the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his\\\\nhead and said there had obviously been a mistake and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better get back on the\\\\ntrain?\\\\nWhen Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called,\\\\nhe fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with\\\\nNeville. When it finally shouted, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGRYFFINDOR,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Neville ran off still wearing\\\\nit, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMacDougal, Morag.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nMalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at\\\\nonce: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSLYTHERIN!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nMalfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with\\\\nhimself.\\\\nThere weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t many people left now. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMoon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6,\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cParkinson\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6, then a pair of twin girls, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPatil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPatil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6, then \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPerks,\\\\nSally-Anne\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6, and then, at last \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPotter, Harry!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAs Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing\\\\nfires all over the hall.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPotter, did she say?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Harry Potter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the\\\\nhall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking\\\\nat the black inside of the hat. He waited.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHmm,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said a small voice in his ear. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDifficult. Very difficult. Plenty of\\\\ncourage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s talent, A my goodness, yes \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and\\\\na nice thirst to prove yourself, now that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s interesting\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.So where shall I put\\\\nyou?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not\\\\nSlytherin.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot Slytherin, eh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the small voice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre you sure? You could be\\\\ngreat, you know, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the\\\\nway to greatness, no doubt about that \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 no? Well, if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re sure \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 better be\\\\nGRYFFINDOR!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the\\\\nhat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have\\\\nbeen chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the\\\\nloudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while\\\\nthe Weasley twins yelled, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe got Potter! We got Potter!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry sat down\\\\nopposite the ghost in the ruff he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving\\\\nHarry the sudden, horrible feeling he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold\\\\nwater.\\\\nHe could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat\\\\nHagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back.\\\\nAnd there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus\\\\nDumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d gotten out of the\\\\nChocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s silver hair was the only thing in the\\\\nwhole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell,\\\\n\\\\ntoo, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very\\\\npeculiar in a large purple turban.\\\\nAnd now there were only three people left to be sorted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThomas, Dean,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\na Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTurpin,\\\\nLisa,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s turn. He was pale green by\\\\nnow. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had\\\\nshouted, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGRYFFINDOR!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to\\\\nhim.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell done, Ron, excellent,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry\\\\nas \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cZabini, Blaise,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her\\\\nscroll and took the Sorting Hat away.\\\\nHarry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized\\\\nhow hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.\\\\nAlbus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the\\\\nstudents, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than\\\\nto see them all there.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWelcome,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWelcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we\\\\nbegin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit!\\\\nBlubber! Oddment! Tweak!\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know\\\\nwhether to laugh or not.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs he \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 a bit mad?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked Percy uncertainly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMad?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Percy airily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But\\\\nhe is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with\\\\nfood. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef,\\\\nroast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled\\\\npotatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup,\\\\nand, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.\\\\nThe Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never been\\\\nallowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry\\\\nreally wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of\\\\neverything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat does look good,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry\\\\ncut up his steak.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t eaten for nearly five hundred years,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the ghost. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\n\\\\nneed to, of course, but one does miss it. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve introduced myself? Sir\\\\nNicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor\\\\nTower.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know who you are!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron suddenly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy brothers told me about\\\\nyou \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re Nearly Headless Nick!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the ghost\\\\nbegan stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nSir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going\\\\nat all the way he wanted.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLike this,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole\\\\nhead swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge.\\\\nSomeone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking\\\\npleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his\\\\nhead back onto his neck, coughed, and said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 new Gryffindors! I hope\\\\nyou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have\\\\nnever gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a\\\\nrow! The Bloody Baron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s becoming almost unbearable \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the Slytherin\\\\nghost.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting\\\\nthere, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood.\\\\nHe was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look too\\\\npleased with the seating arrangements.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow did he get covered in blood?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Seamus with great interest.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never asked,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.\\\\nWhen everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food\\\\nfaded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later\\\\nthe desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of,\\\\napple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries,\\\\nJell-O, rice pudding\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\nAs Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m half-and-half,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Seamus. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMe dad\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a Muggle. Mom didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell\\\\nhim she was a witch \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe others laughed.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat about you, Neville?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, my gran brought me up and she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a witch,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Neville, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut the\\\\nfamily thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to\\\\ncatch me off my guard and force some magic out of me \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he pushed me off the\\\\nend of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 but nothing happened until I\\\\n\\\\nwas eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out\\\\nof an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a\\\\nmeringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 all the way down the\\\\ngarden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was\\\\nso happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 they\\\\nthought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was\\\\nso pleased he bought me my toad.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nOn Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about\\\\nlessons (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do hope they start right away, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s so much to learn, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m\\\\nparticularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into\\\\nsomething else, of course, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s supposed to be very difficult \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be\\\\nstarting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d).\\\\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High\\\\nTable again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall\\\\nwas talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban,\\\\nwas talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\\\\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past\\\\nQuirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s turban straight into Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and a sharp, hot pain shot across\\\\nthe scar on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s forehead.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOuch!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry clapped a hand to his head.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Percy.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cN-nothing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the\\\\nfeeling Harry had gotten from the teacher\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s look \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 a feeling that he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t like\\\\nHarry at all.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked Percy.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s looking so\\\\nnervous, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\neveryone knows he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s after Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark\\\\nArts, Snape.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look at him again.\\\\nAt last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to\\\\nhis feet again. The hall fell silent.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAhem \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I\\\\nhave a few start-of-term notices to give you.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFirst years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all\\\\npupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nDumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley\\\\ntwins.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have also been asked by Mr Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that\\\\nno magic should be used between classes in the corridors.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone\\\\ninterested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the\\\\nright-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very\\\\npainful death.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not serious?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he muttered to Percy.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMust be,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s odd, because he\\\\nusually gives us a reason why we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not allowed to go somewhere \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 the forest\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nfull of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us\\\\nprefects, at least.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried\\\\nDumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 smiles had become rather\\\\nfixed.\\\\nDumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly\\\\noff the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the\\\\ntables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEveryone pick their favorite tune,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand off we go!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAnd the school bellowed:\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,\\\\nTeach us something please,\\\\nWhether we be old and bald\\\\nOr young with scabby knees,\\\\nOur heads could do with filling\\\\nWith some interesting stuff,\\\\nFor now they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re bare and full of air,\\\\nDead flies and bits of fluff,\\\\nSo teach us things worth knowing,\\\\nBring back what we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve forgot,\\\\njust do your best, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll do the rest,\\\\nAnd learn until our brains all rot.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nEverybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley\\\\ntwins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore\\\\nconducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was\\\\none of those who clapped loudest.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, music,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, wiping his eyes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA magic beyond all we do here!\\\\n\\\\nAnd now, bedtime. Off you trot!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds,\\\\nout of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s legs were like lead\\\\nagain, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even\\\\nto be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and\\\\npointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden\\\\nbehind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases,\\\\nyawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much\\\\nfarther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.\\\\nA bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as\\\\nPercy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPeeves,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Percy whispered to the first years. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA poltergeist.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He raised\\\\nhis voice, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPeeves \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 show yourself.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nA loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThere was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide\\\\nmouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOooooooh!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, with an evil cackle. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIckle Firsties! What fun!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo away, Peeves, or the Baron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll hear about this, I mean it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d barked\\\\nPercy.\\\\nPeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on\\\\nNeville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he\\\\npassed.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou want to watch out for Peeves,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Percy, as they set off again.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Bloody Baron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the only one who can control him, he won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even listen to\\\\nus prefects. Here we are.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAt the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a\\\\npink silk dress.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPassword?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCaput Draconis,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a\\\\nround hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Neville needed a leg up\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room\\\\nfull of squashy armchairs.\\\\nPercy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys\\\\nthrough another. At the top of a spiral staircase \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 they were obviously in one of\\\\nthe towers \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red,\\\\nvelvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk\\\\nmuch, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGreat food, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGet\\\\noff, Scabbers! He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s chewing my sheets.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry was going to ask Ron if he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell\\\\nasleep almost at once.\\\\nPerhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange\\\\ndream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s turban, which kept talking to him,\\\\ntelling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny.\\\\nHarry told the turban he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and\\\\nheavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and there was Malfoy,\\\\nlaughing at him as he struggled with it \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 then Malfoy turned into the hooknosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 there was a burst of\\\\ngreen light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.\\\\nHe rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he\\\\ndidn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t remember the dream at all.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThere, look.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNext to the tall kid with the red hair.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWearing the glasses?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid you see his face?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid you see his scar?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nWhispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next\\\\nday. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or\\\\ndoubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they\\\\nwouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.\\\\nThere were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide,\\\\nsweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a\\\\nFriday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to\\\\njump. Then there were doors that wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t open unless you asked politely, or\\\\ntickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t really doors at all,\\\\nbut solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where\\\\nanything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the\\\\nportraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor\\\\ncould walk.\\\\nThe ghosts didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of\\\\nthem glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless\\\\nNick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but\\\\nPeeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you\\\\nmet him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on\\\\nyour head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak\\\\nup behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGOT YOUR CONK!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nEven worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus\\\\nFilch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first\\\\nmorning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that\\\\nunluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third\\\\nfloor. He wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into\\\\nit on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were\\\\n\\\\nrescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.\\\\nFilch owned a cat called Mrs Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature\\\\nwith bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. She patrolled the corridors alone.\\\\nBreak a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d whisk off for\\\\nFilch, who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret\\\\npassageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley\\\\ntwins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated\\\\nhim, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs Norris a good kick.\\\\nAnd then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes\\\\nthemselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than\\\\nwaving your wand and saying a few funny words.\\\\nThey had to study the night skies through their telescopes every\\\\nWednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements\\\\nof the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the\\\\ncastle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout,\\\\nwhere they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and\\\\nfound out what they were used for. Easily the most boring class was History of\\\\nMagic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very\\\\nold indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up\\\\nnext morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on\\\\nwhile they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric\\\\nthe Oddball mixed up.\\\\nProfessor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had\\\\nto stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he\\\\ntook the roll call, and when he reached Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name he gave an excited squeak\\\\nand toppled out of sight.\\\\nProfessor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to\\\\nthink she wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to\\\\nthe moment they sat down in her first class.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTransfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you\\\\nwill learn at Hogwarts,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnyone messing around in my class will\\\\nleave and not come back. You have been warned.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThen she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very\\\\nimpressed and couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going\\\\nto be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of\\\\ncomplicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into\\\\na needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any\\\\ndifference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone\\\\nall silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.\\\\n\\\\nThe class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense\\\\nAgainst the Dark Arts, but Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His\\\\nclassroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a\\\\nvampire he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him\\\\none of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African\\\\nprince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nsure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked\\\\neagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and\\\\nstarted talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell\\\\nhung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of\\\\ngarlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.\\\\nHarry was very relieved to find out that he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t miles behind everyone\\\\nelse. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t had\\\\nany idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that\\\\neven people like Ron didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have much of a head start.\\\\nFriday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to\\\\nfind their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat have we got today?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his\\\\nporridge.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDouble Potions with the Slytherins,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Head of\\\\nSlytherin House. They say he always favors them \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be able to see if it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\ntrue.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWish McGonagall favored us,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. Professor McGonagall was\\\\nhead of Gryffindor House, but it hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stopped her from giving them a huge pile\\\\nof homework the day before.\\\\nJust then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it\\\\nhad given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls\\\\nhad suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables\\\\nuntil they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.\\\\nHedwig hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to\\\\nnibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with\\\\nthe other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the\\\\nmarmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s plate. Harry tore\\\\nit open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:\\\\nDear Harry,\\\\nI know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a\\\\ncup of tea with me around three?\\\\nI want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with\\\\n\\\\nHedwig.\\\\nHagrid\\\\nHarry borrowed Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back\\\\nof the note, and sent Hedwig off again.\\\\nIt was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because\\\\nthe Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so\\\\nfar.\\\\nAt the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor\\\\nSnape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been\\\\nwrong. Snape didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t dislike Harry \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he hated him.\\\\nPotions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder\\\\nhere than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough\\\\nwithout the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.\\\\nSnape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like\\\\nFlitwick, he paused at Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, Yes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said softly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry Potter. Our new \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 celebrity.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nDraco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their\\\\nhands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes\\\\nwere black like Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, but they had none of Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s warmth. They were cold\\\\nand empty and made you think of dark tunnels.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nhe began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent\\\\nwithout effort. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will\\\\nhardly believe this is magic. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t expect you will really understand the beauty\\\\nof the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power\\\\nof liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the\\\\nsenses.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nif you aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nMore silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks\\\\nwith raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked\\\\ndesperate to start proving that she wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a dunderhead.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPotter!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Snape suddenly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat would I get if I added powdered\\\\nroot of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nPowdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron,\\\\nwho looked as stumped as he was; Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand had shot into the air.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know, sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\nSnape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lips curled into a sneer.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTut, tut \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 fame clearly isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t everything.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe ignored Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a\\\\nbezoar?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without\\\\nher leaving her seat, but Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was.\\\\nHe tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with\\\\nlaughter.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThought you wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry\\\\nforced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked\\\\nthrough his books at the Dursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, but did Snape expect him to remember\\\\neverything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?\\\\nSnape was still ignoring Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s quivering hand.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAt this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon\\\\nceiling.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry quietly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think Hermione does, though, why\\\\ndon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you try her?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nA few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eye, and Seamus winked.\\\\nSnape, however, was not pleased.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSit down,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he snapped at Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFor your information, Potter,\\\\nasphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the\\\\nDraught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat\\\\nand it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they\\\\nare the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nyou all copying that down?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThere was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise,\\\\nSnape said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek,\\\\nPotter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThings didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson\\\\ncontinued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple\\\\npotion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them\\\\nweigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except\\\\nMalfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the\\\\nperfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green\\\\nsmoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to\\\\nmelt Seamus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across\\\\nthe stone floor, burning holes in people\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class\\\\n\\\\nwas standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion\\\\nwhen the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all\\\\nover his arms and legs.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIdiot boy!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one\\\\nwave of his wand. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the\\\\ncauldron off the fire?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nNeville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTake him up to the hospital wing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Snape spat at Seamus. Then he\\\\nrounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Potter \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 why didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought\\\\nhe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s another point\\\\nyou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve lost for Gryffindor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThis was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked\\\\nhim behind their cauldron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t push it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he muttered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAs they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mind\\\\nwas racing and his spirits were low. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d lost two points for Gryffindor in his\\\\nvery first week \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 why did Snape hate him so much?\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCheer up,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s always taking points off Fred and\\\\nGeorge. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAt five to three they left the castle and made their way across the\\\\ngrounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden\\\\nforest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.\\\\nWhen Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and\\\\nseveral booming barks. Then Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice rang out, saying, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBack, Fang \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nback.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHang on,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBack, Fang.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous\\\\nblack boarhound.\\\\nThere was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from\\\\nthe ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a\\\\nmassive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMake yerselves at home,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded\\\\nstraight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as\\\\nfierce as he looked.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is Ron,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a\\\\nlarge teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnother Weasley, eh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, glancing at Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s freckles. I spent\\\\n\\\\nhalf me life chasin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 yer twin brothers away from the forest.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their\\\\nteeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all\\\\nabout their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s knee and drooled all\\\\nover his robes.\\\\nHarry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat old git.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 as fer that cat, Mrs Norris, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like ter introduce her to Fang\\\\nsometime. D\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me\\\\neverywhere? Can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get rid of her \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Filch puts her up to it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry told Hagrid about Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not\\\\nto worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut he seemed to really hate me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRubbish!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy should he?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nYet Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help thinking that Hagrid didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t quite meet his eyes\\\\nwhen he said that.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s yer brother Charlie?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid asked Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI liked him a lot \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\ngreat with animals.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While\\\\nRon told Hagrid all about Charlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece\\\\nof paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the\\\\nDaily Prophet:\\\\nGRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST\\\\nInvestigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely\\\\nbelieved to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.\\\\nGringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that\\\\nwas searched had in fact been emptied the same day.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you\\\\nknow what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s good for you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.\\\\nHarry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob\\\\nGringotts, but Ron hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mentioned the date.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday!\\\\nIt might\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been happening while we were there!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThere was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t meet Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes\\\\nthis time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story\\\\nagain. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same\\\\nday. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it\\\\nemptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves\\\\n\\\\nwere looking for?\\\\nAs Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets\\\\nweighed down with rock cakes they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought\\\\nthat none of the lessons he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had so far had given him as much to think about as\\\\ntea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it\\\\nnow? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to tell\\\\nHarry?\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHarry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley,\\\\nbut that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had\\\\nPotions with the Slytherins, so they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or\\\\nat least, they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor\\\\ncommon room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on\\\\nThursday \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTypical,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry darkly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust what I always wanted. To make a fool\\\\nof myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know that you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll make a fool of yourself,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron\\\\nreasonably. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnyway, I know Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s always going on about how good he is at\\\\nQuidditch, but I bet that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all talk.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nMalfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about\\\\nfirst years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful\\\\nstories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in\\\\nhelicopters. He wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it,\\\\nhe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his\\\\nbroomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d listen about the time he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d\\\\nalmost hit a hang glider on Charlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s old broom. Everyone from wizarding\\\\nfamilies talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument\\\\nwith Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see\\\\nwhat was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to\\\\nfly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s poster of West Ham soccer team,\\\\ntrying to make the players move.\\\\nNeville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his\\\\ngrandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had good\\\\nreason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents\\\\neven with both feet on the ground.\\\\nHermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was.\\\\nThis was something you couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t learn by heart out of a book \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 not that she\\\\nhadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips\\\\nshe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville\\\\n\\\\nwas hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him\\\\nhang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when\\\\nHermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.\\\\nHarry hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t had a single letter since Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s note, something that\\\\nMalfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eagle owl was always\\\\nbringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the\\\\nSlytherin table.\\\\nA barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He\\\\nopened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble,\\\\nwhich seemed to be full of white smoke.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a Remembrall!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he explained. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGran knows I forget things \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 this\\\\ntells you if there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s something you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like\\\\nthis and if it turns red \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 oh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d His face fell, because the Remembrall had\\\\nsuddenly glowed scarlet, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve forgotten something\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nNeville was trying to remember what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d forgotten when Draco Malfoy,\\\\nwho was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.\\\\nHarry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason\\\\nto fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than\\\\nany teacher in the school, was there in a flash.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going on?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMalfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got my Remembrall, Professor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nScowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust looking,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle\\\\nbehind him.\\\\nAt three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried\\\\ndown the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear,\\\\nbreezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the\\\\nsloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to\\\\nthe forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.\\\\nThe Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying\\\\nin neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain\\\\nabout the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew\\\\ntoo high, or always flew slightly to the left.\\\\nTheir teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and\\\\nyellow eyes like a hawk.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, what are you all waiting for?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she barked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEveryone stand by a\\\\nbroomstick. Come on, hurry up.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck\\\\n\\\\nout at odd angles.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStick out your right hand over your broom,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d called Madam Hooch at the\\\\nfront, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand say \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Up!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUP\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d everyone shouted.\\\\nHarry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few\\\\nthat did. Hermione Granger\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s had simply rolled over on the ground, and\\\\nNeville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you\\\\nwere afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice that said only\\\\ntoo clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.\\\\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without\\\\nsliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.\\\\nHarry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been doing it wrong\\\\nfor years.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\nMadam Hooch. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKeep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come\\\\nstraight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 three \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 two\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nBut Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the\\\\nground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lips.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome back, boy!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a\\\\ncork shot out of a bottle \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 twelve feet \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 twenty feet. Harry saw his scared\\\\nwhite face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways\\\\noff the broom and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nWHAM \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the\\\\ngrass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to\\\\ndrift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.\\\\nMadam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBroken wrist,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry heard her mutter. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome on, boy \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all right,\\\\nup you get.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nShe turned to the rest of the class.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNone of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You\\\\nleave those brooms where they are or you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be out of Hogwarts before you can\\\\nsay \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Quidditch.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Come on, dear.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nNeville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with\\\\nMadam Hooch, who had her arm around him.\\\\nNo sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid you see his face, the great lump?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe other Slytherins joined in.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShut up, Malfoy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d snapped Parvati Patil.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOoh, sticking up for Longbottom?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced\\\\nSlytherin girl. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever thought you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the\\\\ngrass. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that stupid thing Longbottom\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gran sent him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGive that here, Malfoy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to\\\\nwatch.\\\\nMalfoy smiled nastily.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 how about \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nup a tree?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGive it here!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick\\\\nand taken off. He hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the\\\\ntopmost branches of an oak he called, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome and get it, Potter!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry grabbed his broom.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shouted Hermione Granger. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMadam Hooch told us not to move\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get us all into trouble.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the\\\\nbroom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed\\\\nthrough his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and in a rush of fierce\\\\njoy he realized he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d found something he could do without being taught \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 this\\\\nwas easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even\\\\nhigher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring\\\\nwhoop from Ron.\\\\nHe turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy\\\\nlooked stunned.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGive it here,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry called, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cor I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll knock you off that broom!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, yeah?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.\\\\nHarry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the\\\\nbroom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy\\\\nonly just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the\\\\nbroom steady. A few people below were clapping.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry called.\\\\nThe same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCatch it if you can, then!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high\\\\ninto the air and streaked back toward the ground.\\\\nHarry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then\\\\nstart to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 next\\\\nsecond he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 wind whistled\\\\nin his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he stretched out his\\\\n\\\\nhand \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom\\\\nstraight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched\\\\nsafely in his fist.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHARRY POTTER!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHis heart sank faster than he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just dived. Professor McGonagall was\\\\nrunning toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 in all my time at Hogwarts \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nProfessor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses\\\\nflashed furiously, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 how dare you \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 might have broken your neck \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t his fault, Professor \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBe quiet, Miss Patil \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut Malfoy \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s enough, Mr Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s triumphant faces as\\\\nhe left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wake as she strode toward\\\\nthe castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say\\\\nsomething to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his\\\\nvoice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him;\\\\nhe had to jog to keep up. Now he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d done it. He hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even lasted two weeks.\\\\nHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he\\\\nturned up on the doorstep?\\\\nUp the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor\\\\nMcGonagall didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched\\\\nalong corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking\\\\nhim to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as\\\\ngamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s assistant. His stomach twisted as he\\\\nimagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped\\\\naround the grounds carrying Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s bag.\\\\nProfessor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door\\\\nand poked her head inside.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExcuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nWood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to\\\\nuse on him?\\\\nBut Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out\\\\nof Flitwick\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s class looking confused.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFollow me, you two,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on\\\\nup the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nProfessor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty\\\\n\\\\nexcept for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOut, Peeves!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which\\\\nclanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the\\\\ndoor behind him and turned to face the two boys.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPotter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve found you a Seeker.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nWood\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre you serious, Professor?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbsolutely,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall crisply. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe boy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a natural.\\\\nI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick,\\\\nPotter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry nodded silently. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have a clue what was going on, but he\\\\ndidn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to\\\\nhis legs.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Professor\\\\nMcGonagall told Wood. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDidn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nhave done it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nWood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEver seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked excitedly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWood\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s captain of the Gryffindor team,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Professor McGonagall\\\\nexplained.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just the build for a Seeker, too,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood, now walking around\\\\nHarry and staring at him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLight \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94speedy \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have to get him a decent\\\\nbroom, Professor \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d say.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t bend the firstyear rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that\\\\nlast match by Slytherin, I couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nProfessor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI want to hear you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind\\\\nabout punishing you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThen she suddenly smiled.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour father would have been proud,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe was an excellent\\\\nQuidditch player himself.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re joking.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened\\\\nwhen he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak\\\\nand kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d forgotten all about it.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSeeker?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut first years never \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 you must be the youngest\\\\nhouse player in about \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 a century,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt\\\\nparticularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWood told me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI start training next week,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOnly don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell anyone, Wood\\\\nwants to keep it a secret.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nFred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and\\\\nhurried over.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell done,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said George in a low voice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWood told us. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re on the\\\\nteam too \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Beaters.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI tell you, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\nFred. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t won since Charlie left, but this year\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s team is going to be\\\\nbrilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnyway, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s found a new secret\\\\npassageway out of the school.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBet it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found\\\\nin our first week. See you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nFred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome\\\\nturned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHaving a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the\\\\nMuggles?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re a lot braver now that you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re back on the ground and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got\\\\nyour little friends with you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at\\\\nall little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers,\\\\nneither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d take you on anytime on my own,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Malfoy. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTonight, if you\\\\nwant. Wizard\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s duel. Wands only \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 no contact. What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the matter? Never heard\\\\nof a wizard\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s duel before, I suppose?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf course he has,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, wheeling around. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m his second, who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nyours?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nMalfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCrabbe,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMidnight all right? We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll meet you in the trophy\\\\nroom; that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s always unlocked.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nWhen Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat is a wizard\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s duel?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what do you mean, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re\\\\nmy second?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, a second\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s there to take over if you die,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron casually, getting\\\\nstarted at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face, he added\\\\nquickly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The\\\\nmost you and Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you\\\\n\\\\nknows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse,\\\\nanyway.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThrow it away and punch him on the nose,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron suggested.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExcuse me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a person eat in peace in this place?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron.\\\\nHermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBet you could,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron muttered.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and you mustn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go wandering around the school at night, think of\\\\nthe points you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll lose Gryffindor if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re caught, and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re bound to be. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nreally very selfish of you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really none of your business,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood-bye,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron.\\\\nAll the same, it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t what you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d call the perfect end to the day, Harry\\\\nthought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep\\\\n(Neville wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving\\\\nhim advice such as \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf he tries to curse you, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better dodge it, because I\\\\ncan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t remember how to block them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d There was a very good chance they were\\\\ngoing to get caught by Filch or Mrs Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his\\\\nluck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sneering\\\\nface kept looming up out of the darkness \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 this was his big chance to beat\\\\nMalfoy face-to-face. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t miss it.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHalf-past eleven,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron muttered at last, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better go.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across\\\\nthe tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common\\\\nroom. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs\\\\ninto hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a\\\\nvoice spoke from the chair nearest them, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to do this,\\\\nHarry.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nA lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe\\\\nand a frown.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron furiously. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo back to bed!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI almost told your brother,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione snapped, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPercy \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a prefect,\\\\nhe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d put a stop to this.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe anyone could be so interfering.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome on,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady\\\\n\\\\nand climbed through the hole.\\\\nHermione wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through\\\\nthe portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I\\\\ndon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll lose all the points I got\\\\nfrom Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo away.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re\\\\non the train home tomorrow, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re so \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nBut what they were, they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t find out. Hermione had turned to the\\\\nportrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty\\\\npainting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked\\\\nout of Gryffindor tower.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow what am I going to do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she asked shrilly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s your problem,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to go, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to be\\\\nlate.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught\\\\nup with them.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m coming with you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are not.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cD\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99you think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me?\\\\nIf he finds all three of us I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and\\\\nyou can back me up.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got some nerve \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron loudly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShut up, both of you!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry sharply. I heard something.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt was a sort of snuffling.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMrs Norris?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.\\\\nIt wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t Mrs Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast\\\\nasleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank goodness you found me! I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been out here for hours, I couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nremember the new password to get in to bed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKeep your voice down, Neville. The password\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Pig snout\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 but it won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nhelp you now, the Fat Lady\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone off somewhere.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s your arm?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFine,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Neville, showing them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMadam Pomfrey mended it in\\\\nabout a minute.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 well, look, Neville, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to be somewhere, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll see you\\\\nlater \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t leave me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Neville, scrambling to his feet, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to\\\\n\\\\nstay here alone, the Bloody Baron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s been past twice already.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and\\\\nNeville.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf either of you get us caught, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll never rest until I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve learned that Curse\\\\nof the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the\\\\nCurse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all\\\\nforward.\\\\nThey flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high\\\\nwindows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs Norris, but they\\\\nwere lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the\\\\ntrophy room.\\\\nMalfoy and Crabbe weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t there yet. The crystal trophy cases\\\\nglimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues\\\\nwinked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping\\\\ntheir eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case\\\\nMalfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s late, maybe he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s chickened out,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron whispered.\\\\nThen a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just\\\\nraised his wand when they heard someone speak \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t Malfoy.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt was Filch speaking to Mrs Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly\\\\nat the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently\\\\ntoward the door, away from Filch\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice. Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s robes had barely whipped\\\\nround the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re in here somewhere,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d they heard him mutter, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cprobably hiding.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis way!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to\\\\ncreep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting\\\\nnearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he\\\\ntripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a\\\\nsuit of armor.\\\\nThe clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRUN!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not\\\\nlooking back to see whether Filch was following \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 they swung around the\\\\ndoorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without\\\\nany idea where they were or where they were going \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 they ripped through a\\\\ntapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came\\\\nout near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy\\\\nroom.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve lost him,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and\\\\nwiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.\\\\nI \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 told \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest,\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 told \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cquickly as\\\\npossible.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMalfoy tricked you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione said to Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou realize that, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nyou? He was never going to meet you \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Filch knew someone was going to be in\\\\nthe trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry thought she was probably right, but he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to tell her that.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s go.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to be that simple. They hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t gone more than a dozen\\\\npaces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom\\\\nin front of them.\\\\nIt was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShut up, Peeves \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 please \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get us thrown out.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nPeeves cackled.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty,\\\\nnaughty, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get caughty.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot if you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t give us away, Peeves, please.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShould tell Filch, I should,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes\\\\nglittered wickedly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s for your own good, you know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGet out of the way,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a\\\\nbig mistake.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSTUDENTS OUT OF BED!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Peeves bellowed, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSTUDENTS OUT OF\\\\nBED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nDucking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the\\\\ncorridor where they slammed into a door \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and it was locked.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re\\\\ndone for! This is the end!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward\\\\nPeeves\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shouts.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, move over,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wand, tapped\\\\nthe lock, and whispered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAlohomora!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe lock clicked and the door swung open \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 they piled through it, shut\\\\nit quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhich way did they go, Peeves?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Filch was saying. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuick, tell me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSay \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98please.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say nothing if you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say please,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Peeves in his annoying\\\\nsingsong voice.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 please.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say nothing if you didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say\\\\nplease! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away\\\\nand Filch cursing in rage.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe thinks this door is locked,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry whispered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be okay\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 get off, Neville!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nbathrobe for the last minute. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry turned around \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he\\\\nwas sure he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d walked into a nightmare \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 this was too much, on top of\\\\neverything that had happened so far.\\\\nThey weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor.\\\\nThe forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was\\\\nforbidden.\\\\nThey were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that\\\\nfilled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs\\\\nof rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three\\\\ndrooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.\\\\nIt was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew\\\\nthat the only reason they weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t already dead was that their sudden appearance\\\\nhad taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no\\\\nmistaking what those thunderous growls meant.\\\\nHarry groped for the doorknob \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 between Filch and death, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d take\\\\nFilch.\\\\nThey fell backward \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they\\\\nalmost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for\\\\nthem somewhere else, because they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see him anywhere, but they hardly\\\\ncared \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them\\\\nand that monster. They didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop running until they reached the portrait of the\\\\nFat Lady on the seventh floor.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere on earth have you all been?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she asked, looking at their\\\\nbathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever mind that \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 pig snout, pig snout,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d panted Harry, and the portrait\\\\nswung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed,\\\\ntrembling, into armchairs.\\\\nIt was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked\\\\nas if he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never speak again.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do they think they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in\\\\n\\\\na school?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron finally. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf any dog needs exercise, that one does.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\ndon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t use your eyes, any of you, do you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she snapped. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDidn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you see what it\\\\nwas standing on.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe floor?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry suggested. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t looking at its feet, I was too\\\\nbusy with its heads.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s obviously guarding\\\\nsomething.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nShe stood up, glaring at them.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI hope you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nor worse, expelled. Now, if you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mind, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to bed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon stared after her, his mouth open.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, we don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mind,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d think we dragged her along,\\\\nwouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you.\\\\nBut Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he\\\\nclimbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6What had Hagrid\\\\nsaid? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to\\\\nhide \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 except perhaps Hogwarts.\\\\nIt looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package\\\\nfrom vault seven hundred and thirteen was.\\\\n\\\\nMalfoy couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still\\\\nat Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the\\\\nnext morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had\\\\nbeen an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In\\\\nthe meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been\\\\nmoved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what\\\\ncould possibly need such heavy protection.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s either really valuable or really dangerous,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOr both,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was\\\\nabout two inches long, they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have much chance of guessing what it was\\\\nwithout further clues.\\\\nNeither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay\\\\nunderneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going\\\\nnear the dog again.\\\\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such\\\\na bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted\\\\nnow was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a\\\\nthing arrived in the mail about a week later.\\\\nAs the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s attention\\\\nwas caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls.\\\\nHarry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel,\\\\nand was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him,\\\\nknocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when\\\\nanother owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.\\\\nHarry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said:\\\\nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.\\\\nIt contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want\\\\neverybody knowing you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got a broomstick or they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll all want one. Oliver\\\\nWood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock for your first\\\\ntraining session.\\\\n\\\\nProfessor McGonagall\\\\nHarry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA Nimbus Two Thousand!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron moaned enviously. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never even\\\\ntouched one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private\\\\nbefore their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way\\\\nupstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and\\\\nfelt it.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a broomstick,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture\\\\nof jealousy and spite on his face. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years\\\\naren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t allowed them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t resist it.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not any old broomstick,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a Nimbus Two Thousand.\\\\nWhat did you say you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron\\\\ngrinned at Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cComets look flashy, but they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not in the same league as the\\\\nNimbus.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t afford half the\\\\nhandle,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Malfoy snapped back. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose you and your brothers have to save up\\\\ntwig by twig.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nBefore Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nelbow.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot arguing, I hope, boys?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he squeaked.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPotter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s been sent a broomstick, Professor,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Malfoy quickly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, yes, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProfessor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And\\\\nwhat model is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA Nimbus Two Thousand, it is,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the\\\\nlook of horror on Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really thanks to Malfoy here that I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve\\\\ngot it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he added.\\\\nHarry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nobvious rage and confusion.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s true,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble\\\\nstaircase, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stolen Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Remembrall I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be on the team.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo I suppose you think that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a reward for breaking rules?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d came an\\\\nangry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs,\\\\nlooking disapprovingly at the package in Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI thought you weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speaking to us?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s doing us so much good.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHermione marched away with her nose in the air.\\\\nHarry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It\\\\nkept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under\\\\nhis bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be learning to play that\\\\nnight. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating,\\\\nand then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWow,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s bedspread.\\\\nEven Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it\\\\nlooked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of\\\\nneat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top.\\\\nAs seven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk\\\\ntoward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds\\\\nof seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high\\\\nenough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden\\\\npoles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks\\\\nMuggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.\\\\nToo eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick\\\\nand kicked off from the ground. What a feeling \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he swooped in and out of the\\\\ngoal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand\\\\nturned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHey, Potter, come down!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nOliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his\\\\narm. Harry landed next to him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery nice,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood, his eyes glinting. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see what McGonagall\\\\nmeant\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6you really are a natural. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m just going to teach you the rules this\\\\nevening, then you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be joining team practice three times a week.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRight,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even\\\\nif it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them\\\\nare called Chasers.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThree Chasers,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball\\\\nabout the size of a soccer ball.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis ball\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s called the Quaffle,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Chasers throw the\\\\nQuaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal.\\\\nTen points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry recited. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six\\\\n\\\\nhoops, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s basketball?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood curiously.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever mind,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry quickly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s another player on each side who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s called the Keeper \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m\\\\nKeeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team\\\\nfrom scoring.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThree Chasers, one Keeper,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, who was determined to\\\\nremember it all. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are\\\\nthey for?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He pointed at the three balls left inside the box.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll show you now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTake this.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to show you what the Bludgers do,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Wood said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThese two\\\\nare the Bludgers.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than\\\\nthe red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the\\\\nstraps holding them inside the box.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStand back,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the\\\\nBludgers.\\\\nAt once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at\\\\nHarry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and\\\\nsent it zigzagging away into the air \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it zoomed around their heads and then\\\\nshot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate\\\\nand strapping it down safely. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock\\\\nplayers off their brooms. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why you have two Beaters on each team \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 the\\\\nWeasley twins are ours \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers\\\\nand try and knock them toward the other team. So \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 think you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got all that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThree Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the\\\\ngoal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry reeled\\\\noff.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery good,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked, hoping he\\\\nsounded offhand.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever at Hogwarts. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing\\\\nworse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s you. And\\\\nyou don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 unless they crack my head open.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I\\\\nmean, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nWood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball.\\\\nCompared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a\\\\nlarge walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cis the Golden Snitch, and it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the most important ball\\\\nof the lot. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s very hard to catch because it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s so fast and difficult to see. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the\\\\nSeeker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s job to catch it. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters,\\\\nBludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Seeker, because\\\\nwhichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty\\\\npoints, so they nearly always win. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why Seekers get fouled so much. A\\\\ngame of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so\\\\nthe players could get some sleep.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s it any questions?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was\\\\ndoing it that was going to be the problem.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t practice with the Snitch yet,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood, carefully shutting it\\\\nback inside the crate, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s too dark, we might lose it. Let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s try you out with a few\\\\nof these.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few\\\\nminutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as\\\\nhard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.\\\\nHarry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an\\\\nhour, night had really fallen and they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t carry on.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat Quidditch Cup\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have our name on it this year,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood\\\\nhappily as they trudged back up to the castle. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be surprised if you turn\\\\nout better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he\\\\nhadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t gone off chasing dragons.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nPerhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice\\\\nthree evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly\\\\nbelieve it when he realized that he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d already been at Hogwarts two months. The\\\\ncastle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were\\\\nbecoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.\\\\nOn Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking\\\\npumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick\\\\nannounced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly,\\\\nsomething they had all been dying to try since they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d seen him make Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\ntoad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to\\\\npractice. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because\\\\n\\\\nNeville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with\\\\nHermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier\\\\nabout this. She hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t spoken to either of them since the day Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s broomstick\\\\nhad arrived.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t forget that nice wrist movement we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been practicing!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nsqueaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSwish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words\\\\nproperly is very important, too \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98s\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\ninstead of \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98f\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the\\\\nfeather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop.\\\\nSeamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nHarry had to put it out with his hat.\\\\nRon, at the next table, wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t having much more luck.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWingardium Leviosa!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he shouted, waving his long arms like a\\\\nwindmill.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re saying it wrong,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry heard Hermione snap. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Wing-gardium Levi-o-sa, make the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98gar\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 nice and long.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou do it, then, if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re so clever,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron snarled.\\\\nHermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said,\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWingardium Leviosa!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nTheir feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their\\\\nheads.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, well done!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEveryone see here,\\\\nMiss Granger\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s done it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no wonder no one can stand her,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said to Harry as they pushed\\\\ntheir way into the crowded corridor, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cshe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a nightmare, honestly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nSomeone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione.\\\\nHarry caught a glimpse of her face \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and was startled to see that she was in\\\\ntears.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think she heard you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve noticed\\\\nshe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got no friends.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHermione didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t turn up for the next class and wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seen all afternoon.\\\\nOn their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron\\\\noverheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in\\\\nthe girls\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward\\\\nat this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween\\\\n\\\\ndecorations put Hermione out of their minds.\\\\nA thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand\\\\nmore swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the\\\\npumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at\\\\nthe start-of-term banquet.\\\\nHarry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell\\\\ncame sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone\\\\nstared as he reached Professor Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s chair, slumped against the table,\\\\nand gasped, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTroll \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 in the dungeons \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 thought you ought to know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe then sank to the floor in a dead faint.\\\\nThere was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from\\\\nthe end of Professor Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wand to bring silence.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPrefects,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he rumbled, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9clead your Houses back to the dormitories\\\\nimmediately!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nPercy was in his element.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFollow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you\\\\nfollow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming\\\\nthrough! Excuse me, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m a prefect!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow could a troll get in?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked as they climbed the stairs.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ask me, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re supposed to be really stupid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMaybe\\\\nPeeves let it in for a Halloween joke.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions.\\\\nAs they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry\\\\nsuddenly grabbed Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arm.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve just thought \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Hermione.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat about her?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know about the troll.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon bit his lip.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, all right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he snapped. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut Percy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better not see us.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nDucking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped\\\\ndown a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 bathroom. They\\\\nhad just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPercy!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin.\\\\nPeering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the\\\\ncorridor and disappeared from view.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s he doing?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry whispered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he down in the\\\\ndungeons with the rest of the teachers?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSearch me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nQuietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\n\\\\nfading footsteps.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heading for the third floor,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan you smell something?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old\\\\nsocks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.\\\\nAnd then they heard it \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of\\\\ngigantic feet. Ron pointed \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 at the end of a passage to the left, something huge\\\\nwas moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it\\\\nemerged into a patch of moonlight.\\\\nIt was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray,\\\\nits great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a\\\\ncoconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell\\\\ncoming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which\\\\ndragged along the floor because its arms were so long.\\\\nThe troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long\\\\nears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe keys in the lock,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry muttered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe could lock it in.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood idea,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron nervously.\\\\nThey edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nabout to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key,\\\\nslam the door, and lock it.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nFlushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as\\\\nthey reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 a\\\\nhigh, petrified scream \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and it was coming from the chamber they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just\\\\nchained up.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, no,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the girls\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 bathroom!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry gasped.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHermione!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d they said together.\\\\nIt was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have?\\\\nWheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in\\\\ntheir panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside.\\\\nHermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if\\\\nshe was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the\\\\nwalls as it went.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cConfuse it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw\\\\nit as hard as he could against the wall.\\\\nThe troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking\\\\nstupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It\\\\n\\\\nhesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOy, pea-brain!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he\\\\nthrew a metal pipe at it. The troll didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its\\\\nshoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward\\\\nRon instead, giving Harry time to run around it.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome on, run, run!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward\\\\nthe door, but she couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth\\\\nopen with terror.\\\\nThe shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It\\\\nroared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape.\\\\nHarry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He\\\\ntook a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s neck\\\\nfrom behind. The troll couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will\\\\nnotice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wand had still been\\\\nin his hand when he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d jumped \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 it had gone straight up one of the troll\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nostrils.\\\\nHowling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry\\\\nclinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch\\\\nhim a terrible blow with the club.\\\\nHermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that\\\\ncame into his head: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWingardium Leviosa!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe club flew suddenly out of the troll\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand, rose high, high up into the\\\\nair, turned slowly over \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nhead. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that\\\\nmade the whole room tremble.\\\\nHarry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was\\\\nstanding there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done.\\\\nIt was Hermione who spoke first.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs it \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 dead?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, I think it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just been knocked out.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nose. It was covered\\\\nin what looked like lumpy gray glue.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUrgh \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 troll boogers.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe wiped it on the troll\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s trousers.\\\\nA sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up.\\\\nThey hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course,\\\\nsomeone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s roars. A moment\\\\nlater, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed\\\\nby Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll,\\\\n\\\\nlet out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart.\\\\nSnape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and\\\\nHarry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of\\\\nwinning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mind.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat on earth were you thinking of?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall, with\\\\ncold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his\\\\nwand in the air. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re lucky you weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t killed. Why aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you in your\\\\ndormitory?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nSnape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He\\\\nwished Ron would put his wand down.\\\\nThen a small voice came out of the shadows.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPlease, Professor McGonagall \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 they were looking for me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMiss Granger!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHermione had managed to get to her feet at last.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI went looking for the troll because I \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I thought I could deal with it on\\\\nmy own \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 you know, because I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve read all about them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a\\\\nteacher?\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf they hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t found me, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its\\\\nnose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have time to come\\\\nand fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t new to them.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 in that case ...\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three\\\\nof them, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMiss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a\\\\nmountain troll on your own?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last\\\\nperson to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to\\\\nget them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMiss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\nProfessor McGonagall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m very disappointed in you. If you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not hurt at all,\\\\nyou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their\\\\nhouses.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHermione left.\\\\nProfessor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have\\\\ntaken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points.\\\\nProfessor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey hurried out of the chamber and didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak at all until they had\\\\nclimbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite\\\\n\\\\napart from anything else.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe should have gotten more than ten points,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron grumbled.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFive, you mean, once she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s taken off Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood of her to get us out of trouble like that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron admitted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMind\\\\nyou, we did save her.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe might not have needed saving if we hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t locked the thing in with\\\\nher,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry reminded him.\\\\nThey had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPig snout,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d they said and entered.\\\\nThe common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food\\\\nthat had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for\\\\nthem. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each\\\\nother, they all said \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThanks,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and hurried off to get plates.\\\\nBut from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There\\\\nare some things you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t share without ending up liking each other, and\\\\nknocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA s they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains\\\\naround the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning\\\\nthe ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows\\\\ndefrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin\\\\novercoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.\\\\nThe Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing\\\\nin his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If\\\\nGryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house\\\\nchampionship.\\\\nHardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as\\\\ntheir secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was\\\\nplaying Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know which was\\\\nworse \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 people telling him he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be brilliant or people telling him they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be\\\\nrunning around underneath him holding a mattress.\\\\nIt was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nknow how he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all\\\\nthe last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent\\\\nhim Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.\\\\nHarry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a\\\\nQuidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in\\\\n1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most\\\\nserious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people\\\\nrarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up\\\\nmonths later in the Sahara Desert.\\\\nHermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since\\\\nHarry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer\\\\nfor it. The day before Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in\\\\nthe freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue\\\\nfire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their\\\\nbacks to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once\\\\nthat Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to\\\\nblock the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be allowed. Unfortunately,\\\\n\\\\nsomething about their guilty faces caught Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eye. He limped over. He\\\\nhadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off\\\\nanyway.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got there, Potter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLibrary books are not to be taken outside the school,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Snape. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGive\\\\nit to me. Five points from Gryffindor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just made that rule up,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped\\\\naway. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWonder what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wrong with his leg?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDunno, but I hope it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really hurting him,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron bitterly.\\\\nThe Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and\\\\nHermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and\\\\nRon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow will\\\\nyou learn?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers\\\\nanyway.\\\\nHarry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take\\\\nhis mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape?\\\\nGetting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could\\\\nhave it.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBetter you than me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d they said together, but Harry had an idea that\\\\nSnape wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t refuse if there were other teachers listening.\\\\nHe made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no\\\\nanswer. He knocked again. Nothing.\\\\nPerhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed\\\\nthe door ajar and peered inside \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 and a horrible scene met his eyes.\\\\nSnape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above\\\\nhis knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape\\\\nbandages.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBlasted thing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Snape was saying. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow are you supposed to keep your\\\\neyes on all three heads at once?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry tried to shut the door quietly, but \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPOTTER!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nSnape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to\\\\nhide his leg. Harry gulped.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI just wondered if I could have my book back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGET OUT! OUT!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He\\\\nsprinted back upstairs.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid you get it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron asked as Harry joined them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the matter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIn a low whisper, Harry told them what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d seen.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou know what this means?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he finished breathlessly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe tried to get\\\\npast that three-headed dog at Halloween! That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s where he was going when we\\\\nsaw him \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s after whatever it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guarding! And I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d bet my broomstick he let\\\\nthat troll in, to make a diversion!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes were wide.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, she said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not very nice, but he\\\\nwouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHonestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nsnapped Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m with Harry. I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t put anything past Snape. But what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nhe after? What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that dog guarding?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville\\\\nwas snoring loudly, but Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sleep. He tried to empty his mind \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he\\\\nneeded to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 but\\\\nthe expression on Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t easy to\\\\nforget.\\\\nThe next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of\\\\nthe delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking\\\\nforward to a good Quidditch match.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to eat some breakfast.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want anything.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust a bit of toast,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d wheedled Hermione.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not hungry.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry felt terrible. In an hour\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s time he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be walking onto the field.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry, you need your strength,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Seamus Finnigan. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSeekers are\\\\nalways the ones who get clobbered by the other team.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThanks, Seamus,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his\\\\nsausages.\\\\nBy eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around\\\\nthe Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised\\\\nhigh in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.\\\\nRon and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan\\\\nup in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one\\\\nof the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and Dean, who\\\\nwas good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then\\\\nHermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different\\\\n\\\\ncolors.\\\\nMeanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were\\\\nchanging into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in\\\\ngreen).\\\\nWood cleared his throat for silence.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOkay, men,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd women,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Chaser Angelina Johnson.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd women,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Wood agreed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe big one,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Fred Weasley.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe one we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve all been waiting for,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said George.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe know Oliver\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s speech by heart,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Fred told Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwe were on the\\\\nteam last year.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShut up, you two,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is the best team Gryffindor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s had\\\\nin years. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to win. I know it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe glared at them all as if to say, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOr else.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRight. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s time. Good luck, all of you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his\\\\nknees weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.\\\\nMadam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field\\\\nwaiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, I want a nice fair game, all of you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said, once they were all\\\\ngathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to\\\\nthe Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if\\\\nhe had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering\\\\nbanner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart\\\\nskipped. He felt braver.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMount your brooms, please.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.\\\\nMadam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.\\\\nFifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of\\\\nGryffindor \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJORDAN!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSorry, Professor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe Weasley twins\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for\\\\nthe match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a\\\\ngood find of Oliver Wood\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, last year only a reserve \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 back to Johnson and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nno, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains\\\\n\\\\nthe Quaffle and off he goes \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Flint flying like an eagle up there \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to\\\\nsc\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the\\\\nGryffindors take the Quaffle \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice\\\\ndive around Flint, off up the field and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 OUCH \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 that must have hurt, hit in\\\\nthe back of the head by a Bludger \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Quaffle taken by the Slytherins \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nAdrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s blocked by a second\\\\nBludger \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell which \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 nice\\\\nplay by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the\\\\nQuaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really flying \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 dodges a\\\\nspeeding Bludger \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 the goal posts are ahead \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 come on, now, Angelina \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nKeeper Bletchley dives \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 misses \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 GRYFFINDORS SCORE!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nGryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the\\\\nSlytherins.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBudge up there, move along.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to\\\\njoin them.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBin watchin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 from me hut,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, patting a large pair of\\\\nbinoculars around his neck, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut it isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t the same as bein\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 in the crowd. No sign\\\\nof the Snitch yet, eh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNope,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry hasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t had much to do yet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKept outta trouble, though, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s somethin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, raising his\\\\nbinoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.\\\\nWay up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about\\\\nfor some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s game plan.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKeep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Wood had said.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want you attacked before you have to be.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nWhen Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to\\\\nlet off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he\\\\ncaught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the\\\\nWeasleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way,\\\\nmore like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley\\\\ncame chasing after it.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right there, Harry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger\\\\nfuriously toward Marcus Flint.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSlytherin in possession,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Lee Jordan was saying, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cChaser Pucey ducks\\\\ntwo Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 wait a\\\\nmoment \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 was that the Snitch?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nA murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle,\\\\n\\\\ntoo busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left\\\\near.\\\\nHarry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the\\\\nstreak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck\\\\nthey hurtled toward the Snitch \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what\\\\nthey were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch.\\\\nHarry was faster than Higgs \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he could see the little round ball, wings\\\\nfluttering, darting up ahead \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he put on an extra spurt of speed \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nWHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Marcus\\\\nFlint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s broom spun off course, Harry\\\\nholding on for dear life.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFoul!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d screamed the Gryffindors.\\\\nMadam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the\\\\ngoal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch\\\\nhad disappeared from sight again.\\\\nDown in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSend him off, ref! Red\\\\ncard!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are you talking about, Dean?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRed card!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dean furiously. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn soccer you get shown the red card\\\\nand you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re out of the game!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut this isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t soccer, Dean,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron reminded him.\\\\nHagrid, however, was on Dean\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s side.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nLee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJordan!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d growled Professor McGonagall.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI mean, after that open and revolting foul\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJordan, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m warning you \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could\\\\nhappen to anyone, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who\\\\nputs it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning\\\\ndangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden,\\\\nfrightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped\\\\nthe broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never felt anything like\\\\nthat.\\\\nIt happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him\\\\noff. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off.\\\\nHarry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal-posts \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he had half a mind\\\\n\\\\nto ask Wood to call time-out \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and then he realized that his broom was\\\\ncompletely out of his control. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t turn it. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t direct it at all. It\\\\nwas zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing\\\\nmovements that almost unseated him.\\\\nLee was still commentating.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSlytherin in possession \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Flint with the Quaffle \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 passes Spinnet \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\npasses Bell \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 only\\\\njoking, Professor \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Slytherins score \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 A no\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that\\\\nHarry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher, away\\\\nfrom the game, jerking and twitching as it went.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDunno what Harry thinks he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s doing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid mumbled. He stared\\\\nthrough his binoculars. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 know better, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d say he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d lost control of his\\\\nbroom\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6but he can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nSuddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His\\\\nbroom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on.\\\\nThen the whole crowd gasped. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s broom had given a wild jerk and Harry\\\\nswung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid something happen to it when Flint blocked him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Seamus\\\\nwhispered.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid said, his voice shaking. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t nothing interfere\\\\nwith a broomstick except powerful Dark magic \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 no kid could do that to a\\\\nNimbus Two Thousand.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAt these words, Hermione seized Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s binoculars, but instead of\\\\nlooking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are you doing?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d moaned Ron, gray-faced.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI knew it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione gasped, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 look.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands\\\\nopposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under\\\\nhis breath.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s doing something \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 jinxing the broom,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat should we do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLeave it to me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nBefore Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron\\\\nturned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was\\\\nalmost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its\\\\nfeet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely\\\\nonto one of their brooms, but it was no good \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 every time they got near him, the\\\\nbroom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him,\\\\n\\\\nobviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and\\\\nscored five times without anyone noticing.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome on, Hermione,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron muttered desperately.\\\\nHermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and\\\\nwas now racing along the row behind him; she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even stop to say sorry as\\\\nshe knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape,\\\\nshe crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen\\\\nwords. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s robes.\\\\nIt took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A\\\\nsudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little\\\\njar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Snape would never know\\\\nwhat had happened.\\\\nIt was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on\\\\nto his broom.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNeville, you can look!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into\\\\nHagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s jacket for the last five minutes.\\\\nHarry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his\\\\nhand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he hit the field on all\\\\nfours \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 coughed \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and something gold fell into his hand.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got the Snitch!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game\\\\nended in complete confusion.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Flint was still howling\\\\ntwenty minutes later, but it made no difference \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Harry hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t broken any rules\\\\nand Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Gryffindor had won by\\\\none hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He\\\\nwas being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hut, with Ron and\\\\nHermione.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was Snape,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron was explaining, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHermione and I saw him. He was\\\\ncursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t take his eyes off you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRubbish,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, who hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t heard a word of what had gone on\\\\nnext to him in the stands. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy would Snape do somethin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 like that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell\\\\nhim. Harry decided on the truth.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI found out something about him,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he told Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe tried to get past\\\\nthat three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal\\\\nwhatever it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guarding.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHagrid dropped the teapot.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow do you know about Fluffy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFluffy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mine \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub\\\\nlas\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 year \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry eagerly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ask me anymore,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid gruffly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s top secret,\\\\nthat is.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s trying to steal it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRubbish,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid again. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a Hogwarts teacher, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d do\\\\nnothin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 of the sort.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo why did he just try and kill Harry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Hermione.\\\\nThe afternoon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about\\\\nSnape.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve read all about them! You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve\\\\ngot to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blinking at all, I saw him!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m tellin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 yeh, yer wrong!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid hotly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 know why\\\\nHarry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 try an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 kill a student! Now,\\\\nlisten to me, all three of yeh \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 yer meddlin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 in things that don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 concern yeh. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\ndangerous. You forget that dog, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you forget what it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guardin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s between\\\\nProfessor Dumbledore an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Nicolas Flamel \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAha!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cso there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved,\\\\nis there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHagrid looked furious with himself.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nC hristmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to\\\\nfind itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley\\\\ntwins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed\\\\nQuirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed\\\\nto battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back\\\\nto health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.\\\\nNo one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor\\\\ncommon room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had\\\\nbecome icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all\\\\nwere Professor Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in\\\\na mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do feel so sorry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cfor all those\\\\npeople who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not wanted\\\\nat home.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled.\\\\nHarry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy\\\\nhad been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted\\\\nthat the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a widemouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d realized\\\\nthat nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way\\\\nHarry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and\\\\nangry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.\\\\nIt was true that Harry wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas.\\\\nProfessor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of\\\\nstudents who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at\\\\nonce. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best\\\\nChristmas he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr\\\\nand Mrs Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.\\\\nWhen they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir\\\\ntree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom\\\\nand a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHi, Hagrid, want any help?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron asked, sticking his head through the\\\\n\\\\nbranches.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNah, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m all right, thanks, Ron.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWould you mind moving out of the way?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d came Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cold drawl\\\\nfrom behind them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping\\\\nto be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 that hut of\\\\nHagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s must seem like a palace compared to what your family\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s used to.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWEASLEY!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon let go of the front of Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s robes.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe was provoked, Professor Snape,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, sticking his huge\\\\nhairy face out from behind the tree. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMalfoy was insultin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 his family.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBe that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\nSnape silkily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFive points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nmore. Move along, all of you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering\\\\nneedles everywhere and smirking.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get him,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s back, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cone of\\\\nthese days, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get him \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI hate them both,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMalfoy and Snape.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome on, cheer up, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nearly Christmas,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTell yeh what,\\\\ncome with me an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 see the Great Hall, looks a treat.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nSo the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall,\\\\nwhere Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the\\\\nChristmas decorations.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, Hagrid, the last tree \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 put it in the far corner, would you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all\\\\naround the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around\\\\nthe room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of\\\\ncandles.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow many days you got left until yer holidays?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid asked.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust one,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd that reminds me \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Harry, Ron, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve\\\\ngot half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yeah, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor\\\\nFlitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing\\\\nthem over the branches of the new tree.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe library?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust before\\\\nthe holidays? Bit keen, aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t yeh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not working,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry told him brightly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEver since you\\\\nmentioned Nicolas Flamel we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been trying to find out who he is.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid looked shocked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cListen here \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve told yeh \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\ndrop it. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 to you what that dog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guardin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUnless you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like to tell us and save us the trouble?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry added. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\nmust\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been through hundreds of books already and we can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t find him\\\\nanywhere \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 just give us a hint \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I know I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve read his name somewhere.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sayin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 nothin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, said Hagrid flatly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust have to find out for ourselves, then,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, and they left Hagrid\\\\nlooking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.\\\\nThey had indeed been searching books for Flamel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name ever since\\\\nHagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape\\\\nwas trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin,\\\\nnot knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nin Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our\\\\nTime; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A\\\\nStudy of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the\\\\nsheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves;\\\\nhundreds of narrow rows.\\\\nHermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search\\\\nwhile Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the\\\\nshelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been\\\\nwondering for a while if Flamel wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you\\\\nneeded a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the\\\\nrestricted books, and he knew he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never get one. These were the books\\\\ncontaining powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by\\\\nolder students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are you looking for, boy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\nMadam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better get out, then. Go on \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 out!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nWishing he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the\\\\nlibrary. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better not ask Madam\\\\nPince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be able to tell them,\\\\nbut they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t risk Snape hearing what they were up to.\\\\nHarry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found\\\\nanything, but he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks,\\\\nafter A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t surprising\\\\nthey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without\\\\nMadam Pince breathing down their necks.\\\\n\\\\nFive minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads.\\\\nThey went off to lunch.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will keep looking while I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m away, won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd send me an owl if you find anything.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be safe to ask them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery safe, as they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re both dentists,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione.\\\\nOnce the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to\\\\nthink much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the\\\\ncommon room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good\\\\narmchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a\\\\ntoasting fork \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 bread, English muffins, marshmallows \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and plotting ways of\\\\ngetting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nwork.\\\\nRon also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like\\\\nMuggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like\\\\ndirecting troops in battle. Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s set was very old and battered. Like everything\\\\nelse he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 in this\\\\ncase, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a drawback at all. Ron\\\\nknew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.\\\\nHarry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they\\\\ndidn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t trust him at all. He wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a very good player yet and they kept shouting\\\\ndifferent bits of advice at him, which was confusing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t send me there, can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nyou see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nOn Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for\\\\nthe food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early\\\\nin the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at\\\\nthe foot of his bed.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMerry Christmas,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and\\\\npulled on his bathrobe.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou, too,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWill you look at this? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got some presents!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat did you expect, turnips?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, turning to his own pile, which\\\\nwas a lot bigger than Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s.\\\\nHarry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and\\\\nscrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden\\\\nflute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it sounded a bit\\\\nlike an owl.\\\\nA second, very small parcel contained a note.\\\\n\\\\nWe received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From\\\\nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s friendly,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\nRon was fascinated by the fifty pence.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWeird!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98What a shape! This is money?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can keep it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid\\\\nand my aunt and uncle \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 so who sent these?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think I know who that one\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s from,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, turning a bit pink and\\\\npointing to a very lumpy parcel. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy mom. I told her you didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t expect any\\\\npresents and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 oh, no,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he groaned, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cshe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s made you a Weasley sweater.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in\\\\nemerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEvery year she makes us a sweater,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, unwrapping his own,\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand mine\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s always maroon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really nice of her,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very\\\\ntasty.\\\\nHis next present also contained candy \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 a large box of Chocolate Frogs\\\\nfrom Hermione.\\\\nThis only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light.\\\\nHe unwrapped it.\\\\nSomething fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay\\\\nin gleaming folds. Ron gasped.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve heard of those,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of\\\\nEvery Flavor Beans he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d gotten from Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what I think it is \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nthey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re really rare, and really valuable.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the\\\\ntouch, like water woven into material.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s an invisibility cloak,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, a look of awe on his face. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sure\\\\nit is \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 try it on.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is! Look down!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the\\\\nmirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended\\\\nin midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and\\\\nhis reflection vanished completely.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a note!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron suddenly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA note fell out of it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy\\\\nwriting he had never seen before were the following words:\\\\n\\\\nYour father left this in my possession before he died.\\\\nIt is time it was returned to you.\\\\nUse it well.\\\\nA Very Merry Christmas to you.\\\\nThere was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the\\\\ncloak.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d give anything for one of these,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnything. What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the\\\\nmatter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had\\\\nit really once belonged to his father?\\\\nBefore he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung\\\\nopen and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly\\\\nout of sight. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMerry Christmas!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHey, look \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got a Weasley sweater, too!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nFred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F\\\\non it, the other a G.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s is better than ours, though,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Fred, holding up Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nsweater. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe obviously makes more of an effort if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not family.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you wearing yours, Ron?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d George demanded. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome on,\\\\nget it on, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re lovely and warm.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI hate maroon,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got a letter on yours,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d George observed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose she\\\\nthinks you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t forget your name. But we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not stupid \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 we know we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re\\\\ncalled Gred and Forge.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all this noise?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nPercy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He\\\\nhad clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a\\\\nlumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cP for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re all wearing ours, even\\\\nHarry got one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 want \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the\\\\nsweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not sitting with the prefects today, either,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said George.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cChristmas is a time for family.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by\\\\nhis sweater.\\\\n\\\\nHarry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat,\\\\nroast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas;\\\\ntureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93\\\\nand stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic\\\\nparty favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually\\\\nbought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry\\\\npulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t just bang, it went off with a blast\\\\nlike a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the\\\\ninside exploded a rear admiral\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High\\\\nTable, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hat for a flowered bonnet,\\\\nand was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.\\\\nFlaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his\\\\nteeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting\\\\nredder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing\\\\nProfessor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s amazement, giggled and\\\\nblushed, her top hat lopsided.\\\\nWhen Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of\\\\nthings out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous\\\\nballoons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The\\\\nwhite mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to\\\\nend up as Mrs Norris\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Christmas dinner.\\\\nHarry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious\\\\nsnowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they\\\\nreturned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his\\\\nnew chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have\\\\nlost so badly if Percy hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tried to help him so much.\\\\nAfter a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake,\\\\neveryone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch\\\\nPercy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d stolen his\\\\nprefect badge.\\\\nIt had been Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been\\\\nnagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he\\\\nfree to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it.\\\\nRon, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him,\\\\nfell asleep almost as soon as he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry\\\\nleaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.\\\\nHis father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6this had been his father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. He let the material flow over his\\\\nhands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.\\\\n\\\\nHe had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak\\\\naround himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows.\\\\nIt was a very funny feeling.\\\\nUse it well.\\\\nSuddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to\\\\nhim in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark\\\\nand silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never\\\\nknow.\\\\nRon grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him\\\\nback \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 his father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cloak \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he felt that this time \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 the first time \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he wanted\\\\nto use it alone.\\\\nHe crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room,\\\\nand climbed through the portrait hole.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked\\\\nquickly down the corridor.\\\\nWhere should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then\\\\nit came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be able to read as long\\\\nas he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the\\\\ninvisibility cloak tight around him as he walked.\\\\nThe library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his\\\\nway along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in\\\\nmidair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave\\\\nhim the creeps.\\\\nThe Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping\\\\ncarefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he\\\\nheld up his lamp to read the titles.\\\\nThey didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled\\\\nwords in languages Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t understand. Some had no title at all. One\\\\nbook had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back\\\\nof Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought\\\\na faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone\\\\nwas there who shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be.\\\\nHe had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor,\\\\nhe looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book. A large black\\\\nand silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was\\\\nvery heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.\\\\nA piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 the book was\\\\nscreaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high,\\\\nunbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp,\\\\n\\\\nwhich went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor\\\\noutside \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed\\\\nFilch in the doorway; Filch\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and\\\\nHarry slipped under Filch\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the\\\\nbook\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shrieks still ringing in his ears.\\\\nHe came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so\\\\nbusy getting away from the library, he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t paid attention to where he was\\\\ngoing. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t recognize where he was at all.\\\\nThere was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors\\\\nabove there.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was\\\\nwandering around at night, and somebody\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s been in the library Restricted\\\\nSection.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must\\\\nknow a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his\\\\nhorror, it was Snape who replied, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Restricted Section? Well, they can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be\\\\nfar, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll catch them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner\\\\nahead. They couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they\\\\ncame much nearer they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d knock right into him \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 the cloak didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop him from\\\\nbeing solid.\\\\nHe backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It\\\\nwas his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to\\\\nmove it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their\\\\nnoticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall,\\\\nbreathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close,\\\\nvery close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he\\\\nhad hidden in.\\\\nIt looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs\\\\nwere piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 but\\\\npropped against the wall facing him was something that didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look as if it\\\\nbelonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep\\\\nit out of the way.\\\\nIt was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold\\\\nframe, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the\\\\ntop: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there\\\\nwas no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to\\\\nlook at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.\\\\nHe had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He\\\\n\\\\nwhirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book\\\\nhad screamed \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole\\\\ncrowd of people standing right behind him.\\\\nBut the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to\\\\nthe mirror.\\\\nThere he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there,\\\\nreflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nbut still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a\\\\nroom full of invisible people and this mirror\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s trick was that it reflected them,\\\\ninvisible or not?\\\\nHe looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his\\\\nreflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air\\\\nbehind him. If she was really there, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d touch her, their reflections were so\\\\nclose together, but he felt only air \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 she and the others existed only in the mirror.\\\\nShe was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 her\\\\neyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright\\\\ngreen \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying;\\\\nsmiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing\\\\nnext to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very\\\\nuntidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s did.\\\\nHarry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching\\\\nthat of his reflection.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMom?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he whispered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDad?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces\\\\nof the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other\\\\nnoses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nknobbly knees \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.\\\\nThe Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at\\\\nthem, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall\\\\nright through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half\\\\njoy, half terrible sadness.\\\\nHow long he stood there, he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know. The reflections did not fade\\\\nand he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses.\\\\nHe couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away\\\\nfrom his mother\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face, whispered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll come back,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and hurried from the room.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou could have woken me up,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, crossly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can come tonight, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going back, I want to show you the mirror.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like to see your mom and dad,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron said eagerly.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be able to\\\\nshow me your other brothers and everyone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can see them any old time,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust come round my house\\\\nthis summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not\\\\nfinding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you eating\\\\nanything?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them\\\\nagain tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem very\\\\nimportant anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What\\\\ndid it matter if Snape stole it, really?\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre you all right?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou look odd.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nWhat Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror\\\\nroom again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more\\\\nslowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s route from the library,\\\\nwandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m freezing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s forget it and go back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry hissed. I know it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s here somewhere.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but\\\\nsaw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold,\\\\nHarry spotted the suit of armor.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s here \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 just here \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 yes!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his\\\\nshoulders and ran to the mirror.\\\\nThere they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry whispered.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see anything.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook! Look at them all\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6there are loads of them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can only see you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see\\\\nhis family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.\\\\nRon, though, was staring transfixed at his image.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook at me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan you see all your family standing around you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m alone \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 but I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m different \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I look older \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m head\\\\nboy!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m wearing the badge like Bill used to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m holding the\\\\n\\\\nhouse cup and the Quidditch cup \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m Quidditch captain, too.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at\\\\nHarry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you think this mirror shows the future?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow can it? All my family are dead \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 let me have another look \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re only holding the Quidditch cup, what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s interesting about that? I\\\\nwant to see my parents.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t push me \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nA sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion.\\\\nThey hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t realized how loudly they had been talking.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuick!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs Norris\\\\ncame round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same\\\\nthing \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and\\\\nleft.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t safe \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us.\\\\nCome on.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAnd Ron pulled Harry out of the room.\\\\nThe snow still hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t melted the next morning.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWant to play chess, Harry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t we go down and visit Hagrid?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6you go\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know what you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go back\\\\ntonight.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy not?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI dunno, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve just got a bad feeling about it \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and anyway, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had\\\\ntoo many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs Norris are wandering\\\\naround. So what if they can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see you? What if they walk into you? What if you\\\\nknock something over?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou sound like Hermione.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m serious, Harry, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nBut Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in\\\\nfront of the mirror, and Ron wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to stop him.\\\\nThat third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking\\\\nso fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t meet\\\\n\\\\nanyone.\\\\nAnd there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of\\\\nhis grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of\\\\nthe mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his\\\\nfamily. Nothing at all.\\\\nExcept \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 back again, Harry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him.\\\\nSitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore.\\\\nHarry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he\\\\nhadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t noticed him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see you, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStrange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\nDumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with\\\\nHarry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror\\\\nof Erised.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know it was called that, Sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I expect you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve realized by now what it does?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 well \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it shows me my family \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow did you know \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t need a cloak to become invisible,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore gently.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry shook his head.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the\\\\nMirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see\\\\nhimself exactly as he is. Does that help?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry thought. Then he said slowly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt shows us what we want\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\nwhatever we want\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes and no,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore quietly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt shows us nothing more or less\\\\nthan the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never\\\\nknown your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has\\\\nalways been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best\\\\nof all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men\\\\nhave wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven\\\\nmad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask\\\\nyou not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be\\\\n\\\\nprepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.\\\\nNow, why don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry stood up.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSir \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cObviously, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve just done so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dumbledore smiled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou may ask me\\\\none more thing, however.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do you see when you look in the mirror?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry stared.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne can never have enough socks,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnother\\\\nChristmas has come and gone and I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get a single pair. People will insist on\\\\ngiving me books.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that\\\\nDumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he\\\\nshoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.\\\\n\\\\nDumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised\\\\nagain, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed\\\\nfolded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d seen in\\\\nthe mirror as easily, but he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. He started having nightmares. Over and\\\\nover again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light,\\\\nwhile a high voice cackled with laughter.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\nRon, when Harry told him about these dreams.\\\\nHermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different\\\\nview of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of\\\\nbed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf Filch had caught you!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d), and\\\\ndisappointment that he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.\\\\nThey had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book,\\\\neven though Harry was still sure he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d read the name somewhere. Once term had\\\\nstarted, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their\\\\nbreaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice\\\\nhad started again.\\\\nWood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that\\\\nhad replaced the snow couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained\\\\nthat Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s side. If they won\\\\ntheir next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house\\\\nchampionship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win,\\\\nHarry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.\\\\nThen, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood\\\\ngave the team a bit of bad news. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just gotten very angry with the Weasleys,\\\\nwho kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWill you stop messing around!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he yelled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s exactly the sort of\\\\nthing that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll lose us the match! Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s refereeing this time, and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be looking\\\\nfor any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nGeorge Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s refereeing?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nhe ever refereed a Quidditch match? He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not going to be fair if we might\\\\n\\\\novertake Slytherin.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not my fault,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve just got to make sure we play a\\\\nclean game, so Snape hasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got an excuse to pick on us.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nWhich was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for\\\\nnot wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\nThe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end\\\\nof practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room,\\\\nwhere he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing\\\\nHermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t talk to me for a moment,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron when Harry sat down next to\\\\nhim, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI need to concen\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He caught sight of Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the matter with you? You look terrible.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nSpeaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two\\\\nabout Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t play,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione at once.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSay you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re ill,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPretend to break your leg,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione suggested.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cReally break your leg,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a reserve Seeker. If I back out,\\\\nGryffindor can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t play at all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAt that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had\\\\nmanaged to climb through the portrait hole was anyone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guess, because his legs\\\\nhad been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker\\\\nCurse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.\\\\nEveryone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and\\\\nperformed the countercurse. Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet,\\\\ntrembling. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat happened?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with\\\\nHarry and Ron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMalfoy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Neville shakily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI met him outside the library. He said\\\\nhe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been looking for someone to practice that on.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo to Professor McGonagall!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione urged Neville. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cReport him!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nNeville shook his head.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want more trouble,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he mumbled.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to stand up to him, Neville!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s used to\\\\nwalking all over people, but that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no reason to lie down in front of him and\\\\nmake it easier.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no need to tell me I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor,\\\\nMalfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s already done that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Neville choked out.\\\\n\\\\nHarry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the\\\\nvery last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to\\\\nNeville, who looked as though he might cry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re worth twelve of Malfoy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Sorting Hat chose\\\\nyou for Gryffindor, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it? And where\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nNeville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThanks, Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6I think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll go to bed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6D\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99you want the card, you\\\\ncollect them, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAs Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDumbledore again,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe was the first one I ever \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron\\\\nand Hermione.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve found him!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he whispered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve found Flamel! I told you I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d read\\\\nthe name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 listen to this:\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard\\\\nGrindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s blood, and\\\\nhis work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHermione jumped to her feet. She hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t looked so excited since they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d\\\\ngotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStay there!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\ndormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before\\\\nshe was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI never thought to look in here!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she whispered excitedly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI got this out\\\\nof the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLight?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d looked\\\\nsomething up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to\\\\nherself.\\\\nAt last she found what she was looking for.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI knew it! I knew it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre we allowed to speak yet?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored\\\\nhim.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNicolas Flamel,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she whispered dramatically, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cis the only known maker\\\\nof the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThis didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have quite the effect she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d expected.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry and Ron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, honestly, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you two read? Look \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 read that, there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nShe pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:\\\\nThe ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone,\\\\n\\\\na legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any\\\\nmetal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the\\\\ndrinker immortal.\\\\nThere have been many reports of the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone over the centuries, but\\\\nthe only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr Nicolas Flamel, the noted\\\\nalchemist and opera lover. Mr Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixtyfifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six\\\\nhundred and fifty-eight).\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe dog must be\\\\nguarding Flamel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe\\\\nfor him, because they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re friends and he knew someone was after it, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why he\\\\nwanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo wonder Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s after it! Anyone would want it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd no wonder we couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t find Flamel in that Study of Recent\\\\nDevelopments in Wizardry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not exactly recent if he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s six\\\\nhundred and sixty-five, is he?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down\\\\ndifferent ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing\\\\nwhat they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d do with a Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone if they had one. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t until Ron said\\\\nhe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the\\\\ncoming match.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to play,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he told Ron and Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, all the\\\\nSlytherins will think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m just too scared to face Snape. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll show them\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll\\\\nreally wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust as long as we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not wiping you off the field,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione.\\\\nAs the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous,\\\\nwhatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t too calm,\\\\neither. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was\\\\nwonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to,\\\\nwith such a biased referee?\\\\nHarry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to\\\\nkeep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether\\\\nSnape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were\\\\nturning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could\\\\nSnape possibly know they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d found out about the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone? Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\n\\\\nsee how he could \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could\\\\nread minds.\\\\nHarry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the\\\\nnext afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d ever see\\\\nhim alive again. This wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t what you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a\\\\nword of Wood\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his\\\\nNimbus Two Thousand.\\\\nRon and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to\\\\nNeville, who couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why\\\\nthey had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron\\\\nand Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d gotten\\\\nthe idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he\\\\nshowed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t forget, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Locomotor Mortis,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione muttered as Ron\\\\nslipped his wand up his sleeve.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron snapped. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t nag.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nBack in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture\\\\nof the Snitch it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too\\\\nmuch.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe whole school\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s out there!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Fred Weasley, peering out of the\\\\ndoor. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEven \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 blimey \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s come to watch!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heart did a somersault.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDumbledore?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right.\\\\nThere was no mistaking that silver beard.\\\\nHarry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe. There was\\\\nsimply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was\\\\nwatching.\\\\nPerhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched\\\\nonto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never seen Snape look so mean,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he told Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nthey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re off. Ouch!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nSomeone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, sorry, Weasley, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see you there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nMalfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWonder how long Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone\\\\nwant a bet? What about you, Weasley?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because\\\\n\\\\nGeorge Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers\\\\ncrossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game\\\\nlike a hawk, looking for the Snitch.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nsaid Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another\\\\npenalty for no reason at all. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s people they feel sorry for. See, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Potter,\\\\nwho\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got no parents, then there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the Weasleys, who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got no money \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 you\\\\nshould be on the team, Longbottom, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got no brains.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nNeville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he stammered.\\\\nMalfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not\\\\ndaring to take his eyes from the game, said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou tell him, Neville.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLongbottom, if brains were gold you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be poorer than Weasley, and\\\\nthat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s saying something.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety\\\\nabout Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m warning you, Malfoy \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 one more word\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRon!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione suddenly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat? Where?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and\\\\ncheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as\\\\nHarry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re in luck, Weasley, Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s obviously spotted some money on the\\\\nground!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Malfoy.\\\\nRon snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top\\\\nof him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the\\\\nback of his seat to help.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome on, Harry!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch\\\\nas Harry sped straight at Snape \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling\\\\naround under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists\\\\nthat was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.\\\\nUp in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see\\\\nsomething scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 the next second,\\\\nHarry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in\\\\nhis hand.\\\\nThe stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the\\\\nSnitch being caught so quickly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRon! Ron! Where are you? The game\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s over! Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s won! We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve won!\\\\nGryffindor is in the lead!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat\\\\n\\\\nand hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.\\\\nHarry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe\\\\nit. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d done it \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As\\\\nGryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced\\\\nand tight-lipped \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into\\\\nDumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s smiling face.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell done,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNice to see you haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been brooding about that mirror...been keeping\\\\nbusy...excellent...\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nSnape spat bitterly on the ground.\\\\nHarry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two\\\\nThousand back to the broomshed. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ever remember feeling happier.\\\\nHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d really done something to be proud of now \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 no one could say he was just a\\\\nfamous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked\\\\nover the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur:\\\\nGryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the\\\\ndistance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.\\\\nHarry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and\\\\nlooked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun.\\\\nGryffindor in the lead. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d done it, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d shown Snape ....\\\\nAnd speaking of Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\nA hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly\\\\nnot wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest.\\\\nHarry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nprowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 what was going on?\\\\nHarry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding\\\\nsilently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed.\\\\nThe trees were so thick he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see where Snape had gone. He flew\\\\nin circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard\\\\nvoices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.\\\\nHe climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his\\\\nbroomstick, trying to see through the leaves.\\\\nBelow, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t alone. Quirrell\\\\nwas there, too. Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make out the look on his face, but he was\\\\nstuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6d-don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places,\\\\nSeverus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, I thought we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d keep this private,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Snape, his voice icy.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStudents aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t supposed to know about the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone, after all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape\\\\ninterrupted him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s yet?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cB-b-but Severus, I \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Snape, taking a step\\\\ntoward him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI-I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou know perfectly well what I mean.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAn owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied\\\\nhimself in time to hear Snape say, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 your little bit of hocus-pocus. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m\\\\nwaiting.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cB-but I d-d-don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Snape cut in. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have another little chat soon, when\\\\nyou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was\\\\nalmost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he\\\\nwas petrified.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry, where have you been?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione squeaked.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe won! You won! We won!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the\\\\nback. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and\\\\nGoyle single-handed! He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be all\\\\nright \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 talk about showing Slytherin! I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve waiting for you in the common room,\\\\nwe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the\\\\nkitchens.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever mind that now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry breathlessly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s find an empty\\\\nroom, you wait \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99til you hear this....\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe made sure Peeves wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t inside before shutting the door behind them,\\\\nthen he told them what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d seen and heard.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo we were right, it is the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone, and Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s trying to force\\\\nQuirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and he\\\\nsaid something about Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98hocus pocus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I reckon there are other things\\\\nguarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and\\\\nQuirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break\\\\nthrough \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo you mean the Stone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to\\\\nSnape?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione in alarm.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be gone by next Tuesday,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron.\\\\n\\\\nQuirrell, however, must have been braver than they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d thought. In the weeks\\\\nthat followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look as\\\\nthough he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d cracked yet.\\\\nEvery time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and\\\\nHermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still\\\\ngrowling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which\\\\nsurely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these\\\\ndays he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling\\\\npeople off for laughing at Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s stutter.\\\\nHermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone.\\\\nShe had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes. Harry\\\\nand Ron wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHermione, the exams are ages away.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTen weeks,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione snapped. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not ages, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s like a second to\\\\nNicolas Flamel.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not six hundred years old,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron reminded her. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnyway,\\\\nwhat are you studying for, you already know it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s an A.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass\\\\nthese exams to get into the second year? They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re very important, I should have\\\\nstarted studying a month ago, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gotten into me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nUnfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as\\\\nHermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays\\\\nweren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with\\\\nHermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s blood or practicing\\\\nwand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free\\\\ntime in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll never remember this,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down\\\\nhis quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really\\\\nfine day they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had in months. The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and\\\\nthere was a feeling in the air of summer coming.\\\\nHarry, who was looking up \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDittany\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d in One Thousand Magical Herbs\\\\nand Fungi, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look up until he heard Ron say, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid! What are you doing\\\\n\\\\nin the library?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked\\\\nvery out of place in his moleskin overcoat.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 lookin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re you lot up ter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He looked suddenly suspicious. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYer not still\\\\nlookin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, we found out who he is ages ago,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron impressively. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd we\\\\nknow what that dog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guarding, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s St\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShhhh!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 go shoutin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 about it, what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the matter with yeh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\nHarry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cabout what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSHHHH!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid again. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cListen \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 come an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 see me later, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not\\\\npromisin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll tell yeh anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, mind, but don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 go rabbitin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 about it in here,\\\\nstudents aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99pposed ter know. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve told yeh \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee you later, then,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\nHagrid shuffled off.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat was he hiding behind his back?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione thoughtfully.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you think it had anything to do with the Stone?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to see what section he was in,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had enough\\\\nof working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and\\\\nslammed them down on the table.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDragons!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he whispered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid was looking up stuff about dragons!\\\\nLook at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to\\\\nInferno, A Dragon Keeper\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Guide.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met\\\\nhim, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c said Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s against our laws,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDragon breeding was outlawed by\\\\nthe Warlocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hard to stop\\\\nMuggles from noticing us if we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re keeping dragons in the back garden \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nanyway, you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tame dragons, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dangerous. You should see the burns\\\\nCharlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got off wild ones in Romania.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut there aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t wild dragons in Britain?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf course there are,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCommon Welsh Green and Hebridean\\\\nBlacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our\\\\nkind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve spotted them, to make them\\\\nforget.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo what on earth\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Hagrid up to?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione.\\\\n\\\\nWhen they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hut an hour later, they\\\\nwere surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nbefore he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.\\\\nIt was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was\\\\na blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat\\\\nsandwiches, which they refused.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 yeh wanted to ask me somethin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe were\\\\nwondering if you could tell us what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guarding the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone apart from\\\\nFluffy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHagrid frowned at him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cO\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 course I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNumber one, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 know meself. Number\\\\ntwo, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 tell yeh if I could. That Stone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nhere fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I s\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ppose yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve\\\\nworked that out an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 all? Beats me how yeh even know abou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Fluffy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know,\\\\nyou know everything that goes on round here,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione in a warm,\\\\nflattering voice. Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\nonly wondered who had done the guarding, really.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione went on. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\nwondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at\\\\nHermione.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s see\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6he\\\\nborrowed Fluffy from me\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6then some o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the teachers did enchantments\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\nProfessor Sprout \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Professor Flitwick \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Professor McGonagall \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he ticked\\\\nthem off on his fingers, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProfessor Quirrell \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Dumbledore himself did\\\\nsomethin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 course. Hang on, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor\\\\nSnape.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 yer not still on abou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect\\\\nthe Stone, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not about ter steal it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If\\\\nSnape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out\\\\nhow the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 except,\\\\nit seemed, Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s spell and how to get past Fluffy.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you,\\\\nHagrid?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry anxiously. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell anyone, would you? Not\\\\neven one of the teachers?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot a soul knows except me an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Dumbledore,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid proudly.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s something,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry muttered to the others. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid, can we\\\\nhave a window open? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m boiling.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, Harry, sorry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire.\\\\nHarry looked at it, too.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nBut he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath\\\\nthe kettle, was a huge, black egg.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 er\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere did you get it, Hagrid?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a\\\\ncloser look at the egg. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve cost you a fortune.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWon it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLas\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 night. I was down in the village havin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 a few\\\\ndrinks an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 got into a game o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter\\\\nget rid of it, ter be honest.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what are you going to do with it when it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hatched?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve bin doin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 some readin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, pulling a large book\\\\nfrom under his pillow. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGot this outta the library \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Dragon Breeding for\\\\nPleasure and Profit \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a bit outta date, o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 course, but it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all in here. Keep the\\\\negg in the fire, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98cause their mothers breathe on I em, see, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 when it hatches,\\\\nfeed it on a bucket o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 see\\\\nhere \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 how ter recognize diff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99rent eggs \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 what I got there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a Norwegian\\\\nRidgeback. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re rare, them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid, you live in a wooden house,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said.\\\\nBut Hagrid wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the\\\\nfire.\\\\nSo now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to\\\\nHagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWonder what it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s like to have a peaceful life,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron sighed, as evening\\\\nafter evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting.\\\\nHermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It\\\\nwas driving them nuts.\\\\nThen, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from\\\\nHagrid. He had written only two words: It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hatching.\\\\nRon wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione\\\\nwouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t hear of it.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon\\\\nhatching?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got lessons, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get into trouble, and that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothing to what\\\\n\\\\nHagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to be in when someone finds out what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s doing\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShut up!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry whispered.\\\\nMalfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How\\\\nmuch had he heard? Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t like the look on Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face at all.\\\\nRon and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end,\\\\nHermione agreed to run down to Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s with the other two during morning\\\\nbreak. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three\\\\nof them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the\\\\nedge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nearly out.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He ushered them inside.\\\\nThe egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something\\\\nwas moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.\\\\nThey all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.\\\\nAll at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby\\\\ndragon flopped onto the table. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked\\\\nlike a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its\\\\nskinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and\\\\nbulging, orange eyes.\\\\nIt sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIsn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he beautiful?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke\\\\nthe dragon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBless him, look, he knows his mommy!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9chow fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow,\\\\nexactly?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his\\\\nface \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the matter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSomeone was lookin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 through the gap in the curtains \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a kid \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nhe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s runnin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 back up ter the school.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no\\\\nmistaking him.\\\\nMalfoy had seen the dragon.\\\\nSomething about the smile lurking on Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face during the next week\\\\nmade Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their free\\\\ntime in Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s darkened hut, trying to reason with him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust let him go,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry urged. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSet him free.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s too little. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d die.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a\\\\n\\\\nweek. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been doing his\\\\ngamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were\\\\nempty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve decided to call him Norbert,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, looking at the dragon\\\\nwith misty eyes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nMommy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lost his marbles,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron muttered in Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ear.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry loudly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cgive it two weeks and Norbert\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to\\\\nbe as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHagrid bit his lip.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I know I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t keep him forever, but I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t jus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dump him, I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry suddenly turned to Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCharlie.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re losing it, too,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m Ron, remember?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Charlie \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons.\\\\nWe could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him\\\\nback in the wild!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBrilliant!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow about it, Hagrid?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAnd in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to\\\\nask him.\\\\nThe following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and\\\\nHarry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to\\\\nbed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst\\\\nopen. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s invisibility cloak.\\\\nHe had been down at Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now\\\\neating dead rats by the crate.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt bit me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a\\\\nbloody handkerchief. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell\\\\nyou, that dragon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the most horrible animal I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve ever met, but the way Hagrid\\\\ngoes on about it, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he\\\\ntold me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThere was a tap on the dark window.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Hedwig!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, hurrying to let her in. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have Charlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nanswer!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe three of them put their heads together to read the note.\\\\nDear Ron,\\\\nHow are you? Thanks for the letter \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be glad to take the Norwegian\\\\n\\\\nRidgeback, but it won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to\\\\nsend him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week.\\\\nTrouble is, they mustn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be seen carrying an illegal dragon.\\\\nCould you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday?\\\\nThey can meet you there and take him away while it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s still dark.\\\\nSend me an answer as soon as possible.\\\\nLove,\\\\nCharlie\\\\nThey looked at one another.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got the invisibility cloak,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be too\\\\ndifficult \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two\\\\nagreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and Malfoy.\\\\nThere was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s bitten hand had swollen to\\\\ntwice its usual size. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know whether it was safe to go to Madam\\\\nPomfrey \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had\\\\nno choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nfangs were poisonous.\\\\nHarry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day\\\\nto find Ron in a terrible state in bed.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not just my hand,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he whispered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9calthough that feels like it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s about\\\\nto fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books\\\\nso he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her\\\\nwhat really bit me \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve told her it was a dog, but I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think she believes me\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s doing this.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione, but this didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nsoothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMidnight on Saturday!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said in a hoarse voice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh no oh no \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve\\\\njust remembered \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Charlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to\\\\nknow we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re getting rid of Norbert.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry and Hermione didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey\\\\ncame over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s too late to change the plan now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry told Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got\\\\ntime to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of\\\\n\\\\nNorbert. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have to risk it. And we have got the invisibility cloak, Malfoy\\\\ndoesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know about that.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail\\\\nwhen they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t let you in,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he puffed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNorbert\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s at a tricky stage \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 nothin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I\\\\ncan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t handle.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nWhen they told him about Charlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s letter, his eyes filled with tears,\\\\nalthough that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAargh! It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all right, he only got my boot \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 jus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 playin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s only a\\\\nbaby, after all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry\\\\nand Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t come quickly\\\\nenough.\\\\nThey would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say\\\\ngood-bye to Norbert if they hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been so worried about what they had to do. It\\\\nwas a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hut\\\\nbecause they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall,\\\\nwhere he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and\\\\nready in a large crate.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got lots o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 rats an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 some brandy fer the journey,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid in a\\\\nmuffled voice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nFrom inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as\\\\nthough the teddy was having his head torn off.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBye-bye, Norbert!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the\\\\ncrate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMommy\\\\nwill never forget you!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHow they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never\\\\nknew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in\\\\nthe entrance hall and along the dark corridors. UP another staircase, then another\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 even one of Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shortcuts didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make the work much easier.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNearly there!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the\\\\ntallest tower.\\\\nThen a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the\\\\ncrate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows,\\\\nstaring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet\\\\naway. A lamp flared.\\\\nProfessor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by\\\\nthe ear.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDetention!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she shouted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering\\\\naround in the middle of the night, how dare you \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t understand, Professor. Harry Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coming \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got a\\\\ndragon!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I shall see\\\\nProfessor Snape about you, Malfoy!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest\\\\nthing in the world after that. Not until they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d stepped out into the cold night air\\\\ndid they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione\\\\ndid a sort of jig.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMalfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got detention! I could sing!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry advised her.\\\\nChuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his\\\\ncrate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the\\\\ndarkness.\\\\nCharlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione\\\\nthe harness they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They\\\\nall helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook\\\\nhands with the others and thanked them very much.\\\\nAt last, Norbert was going\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6going\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6gone.\\\\nThey slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their\\\\nhands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Malfoy in detention\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 what could spoil their happiness?\\\\nThe answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped\\\\ninto the corridor, Filch\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, well, well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he whispered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwe are in trouble.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower.\\\\n\\\\nThings couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have been worse.\\\\nFilch took them down to Professor McGonagall\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s study on the first floor,\\\\nwhere they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was\\\\ntrembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased each other around\\\\nHarry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see how they were\\\\ngoing to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have\\\\nbeen so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that\\\\nProfessor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping\\\\naround the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy\\\\ntower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the\\\\ninvisibility cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.\\\\nHad Harry thought that things couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have been worse? He was wrong.\\\\nWhen Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was\\\\ntrying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you,\\\\nhe said you had a drag\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor\\\\nMcGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she\\\\ntowered over the three of them.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI would never have believed it of any of you. Mr Filch says you were\\\\nup in the astronomy tower. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s one o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nquestion. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got a good idea of what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s been going on,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor\\\\nMcGonagall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy\\\\nsome cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into\\\\ntrouble. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve already caught him. I suppose you think it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s funny that Longbottom\\\\nhere heard the story and believed it, too?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry caught Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eye and tried to tell him without words that this\\\\nwasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering\\\\nNeville \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the\\\\ndark, to warn them.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m disgusted,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFour students out of bed in\\\\none night! I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought\\\\nyou had more sense. As for you, Mr Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to\\\\nyou than this. All three of you will receive detentions \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 yes, you too, Mr\\\\nLongbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night,\\\\nespecially these days, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s very dangerous \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and fifty points will be taken from\\\\nGryffindor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFifty?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry gasped \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 they would lose the lead, the lead he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d won in\\\\nthe last Quidditch match.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFifty points each,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily\\\\nthrough her long, pointed nose.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProfessor \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 please \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell me what I can and can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all\\\\nof you. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nA hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one\\\\nnight, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt\\\\nas though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever\\\\nmake up for this?\\\\nHarry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his\\\\npillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think of anything to say to\\\\ncomfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What\\\\nwould happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d done?\\\\nAt first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house\\\\npoints the next day thought there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been a mistake. How could they suddenly\\\\nhave a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started\\\\nto spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch\\\\nmatches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first\\\\nyears.\\\\nFrom being one of the most popular and admired people at the school,\\\\nHarry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on\\\\nhim, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup.\\\\nEverywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t trouble to lower their voices\\\\nas they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past\\\\nthem, whistling and cheering, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThanks Potter, we owe you one!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nOnly Ron stood by him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads\\\\nof points in all the time they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been here, and people still like them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have\\\\nthey?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry miserably.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 no,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron admitted.\\\\nIt was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to\\\\nmeddle in things that weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t his business from now on. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had it with\\\\nsneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood\\\\nand offered to resign from the Quidditch team.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cResign?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Wood thundered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat good\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll that do? How are we going to\\\\nget any points back if we can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t win at Quidditch?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nBut even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak\\\\nto Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe Seeker.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have as bad a time\\\\nas Harry, because they weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t as well-known, but nobody would speak to them,\\\\neither. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her\\\\nhead down and working in silence.\\\\nHarry was almost glad that the exams weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t far away. All the studying\\\\nhe had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to\\\\nthemselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in\\\\ncomplicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of\\\\nmagical discoveries and goblin rebellions....\\\\nThen, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s new\\\\nresolution not to interfere in anything that didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t concern him was put to an\\\\nunexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he\\\\nheard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he\\\\nheard Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 no \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 not again, please \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 all right \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he heard Quirrell sob.\\\\nNext second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening\\\\nhis turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out\\\\nof sight; Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until\\\\nQuirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was\\\\nempty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before\\\\nhe remembered what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d promised himself about not meddling.\\\\nAll the same, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have gambled twelve Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stones that Snape had\\\\njust left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking\\\\nwith a new spring in his step \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.\\\\nHarry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on\\\\n\\\\nAstronomy. Harry told them what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d heard.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s done it, then!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s told him how to break\\\\nhis Anti-Dark Force spell \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s still Fluffy, though,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMaybe Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nsaid Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI bet there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a\\\\nbook somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So\\\\nwhat do we do, Harry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe light of adventure was kindling again in Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes, but Hermione\\\\nanswered before Harry could.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo to Dumbledore. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what we should have done ages ago. If we try\\\\nanything ourselves we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be thrown out for sure.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got no proof!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s too scared to back us\\\\nup. Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s only got to say he doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know how the troll got in at Halloween\\\\nand that he was nowhere near the third floor \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 who do you think they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll believe,\\\\nhim or us? It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll think we made it\\\\nup to get him sacked. Filch wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help us if his life depended on it, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s too\\\\nfriendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll think.\\\\nAnd don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t forget, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll\\\\ntake a lot of explaining.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHermione looked convinced, but Ron didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf we just do a bit of poking around \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry flatly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve done enough poking around.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of\\\\nits moons.\\\\nThe following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and\\\\nNeville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:\\\\nYour detention will take place at eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock tonight.\\\\nMeet Mr Filch in the entrance hall.\\\\nProfessor McGonagall\\\\nHarry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points\\\\nthey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night\\\\nof studying lost, but she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved\\\\nwhat they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d got.\\\\nAt eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common\\\\nroom and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a\\\\ndetention, too.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFollow me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI bet you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you,\\\\neh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, leering at them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6hard work and pain are the best teachers\\\\nif you ask me\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just a pity they let the old punishments die out\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6hang you\\\\nby your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got the chains still in my\\\\noffice, keep \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98em well oiled in case they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re ever needed\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6Right, off we go, and\\\\ndon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think of running off, now, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be worse for you if you do.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry\\\\nwondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really\\\\nhorrible, or Filch wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be sounding so delighted.\\\\nThe moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them\\\\ninto darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hut. Then\\\\nthey heard a distant shout.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it\\\\nwouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because Filch said,\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose you think you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again,\\\\nboy \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s into the forest you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m much mistaken if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll all come\\\\nout in one piece.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAt this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his\\\\ntracks.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe forest?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he repeated, and he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sound quite as cool as usual.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go in there at night \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all sorts of things in there \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nwerewolves, I heard.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nNeville clutched the sleeve of Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s robe and made a choking noise.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s your problem, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Filch, his voice cracking with glee.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShould\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nyou?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He\\\\nwas carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 time,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI bin waitin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fer half an hour already. All right,\\\\nHarry, Hermione?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Filch coldly, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re\\\\nhere to be punished, after all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why yer late, is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBin lecturin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nthem, eh? \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Snot your place ter do that. Yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve done yer bit, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll take over from\\\\nhere.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be back at dawn,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Filch, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cfor what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s left of them,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he added\\\\nnastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away\\\\nin the darkness.\\\\nMalfoy now turned to Hagrid.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not going in that forest,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the\\\\nnote of panic in his voice.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid fiercely. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve\\\\ndone wrong an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 now yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got ter pay fer it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut this is servant stuff, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not for students to do. I thought we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be\\\\ncopying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94tell yer that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s how it is at Hogwarts,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid growled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCopyin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 lines!\\\\nWhat good\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that ter anyone? Yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll do summat useful or yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get out. If yeh\\\\nthink yer father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\npack. Go on.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nMalfoy didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his\\\\ngaze.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRight then,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cnow, listen carefully, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98cause it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dangerous\\\\nwhat we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re gonna do tonight, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 want no one takin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 risks. Follow me over\\\\nhere a moment.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he\\\\npointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black\\\\ntrees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook there,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9csee that stuff shinin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 on the ground? Silvery\\\\nstuff? That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s unicorn blood. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat.\\\\nThis is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re\\\\ngonna try an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Malfoy,\\\\nunable to keep the fear out of his voice.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 that lives in the forest that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll hurt yeh if yer with me or\\\\nFang,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 keep ter the path. Right, now, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re gonna split inter\\\\ntwo parties an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 follow the trail in diff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99rent directions. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s blood all over the\\\\nplace, it must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve bin staggerin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 around since last night at least.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI want Fang,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s long teeth.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right, but I warn yeh, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a coward,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo me, Harry,\\\\nan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll go one way an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Draco, Neville, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Fang\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll go the other. Now, if\\\\nany of us finds the unicorn, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out\\\\nan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 practice now \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s it \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks,\\\\nan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll all come an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 find yeh \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 so, be careful \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s go.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in\\\\n\\\\nthe earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy,\\\\nNeville, and Fang took the right.\\\\nThey walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a\\\\nray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on\\\\nthe fallen leaves.\\\\nHarry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCould a werewolf be killing the unicorns?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot fast enough,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re\\\\npowerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water;\\\\nthere must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn\\\\nblood here and there along the winding path.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou all right, Hermione?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid whispered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 worry, it can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve\\\\ngone far if it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s this badly hurt, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 then we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be able ter \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 GET BEHIND THAT\\\\nTREE!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind\\\\na towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it,\\\\nready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead\\\\nleaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was\\\\nsquinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI knew it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he murmured. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s summat in here that shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 be.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA werewolf?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry suggested.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 no werewolf an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 no unicorn, neither,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid\\\\ngrimly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRight, follow me, but careful, now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly,\\\\nin a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid called. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShow yerself \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m armed!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAnd into the clearing came \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a\\\\nman, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gleaming chestnut\\\\nbody with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s jaws dropped.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s you, Ronan,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid in relief. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow are yeh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe walked forward and shook the centaur\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood evening to you, Hagrid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful\\\\nvoice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWere you going to shoot me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be too careful, Ronan,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, patting his crossbow.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Hermione\\\\nGranger, by the way. Students up at the school. An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 this is Ronan, you two. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\na centaur.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d noticed,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione faintly.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood evening,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ronan. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStudents, are you? And do you learn\\\\nmuch, up at the school?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cErm \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA bit,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione timidly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA bit. Well, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s something.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ronan sighed. He flung back his head\\\\nand stared at the sky. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMars is bright tonight.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, glancing up, too. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cListen, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m glad we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve run inter\\\\nyeh, Ronan, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98cause there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a unicorn bin hurt \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 you seen anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRonan didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then\\\\nsighed again.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAlways the innocent are the first victims,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo it has been for\\\\nages past, so it is now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut have yeh seen anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Ronan? Anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nunusual?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMars is bright tonight,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him\\\\nimpatiently. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUnusually bright.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah, but I was meanin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 unusual a bit nearer home, said\\\\nHagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo yeh haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t noticed anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 strange?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nYet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe forest\\\\nhides many secrets.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nA movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again,\\\\nbut it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking\\\\nthan Ronan.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHullo, Bane,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell enough. Look, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve jus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 bin askin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Ronan, you seen anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 odd in\\\\nhere lately? There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a unicorn bin injured \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 would yeh know anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 about it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nBane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMars is\\\\nbright tonight,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said simply.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve heard,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid grumpily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, if either of you do see\\\\nanythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, let me know, won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t yeh? We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be off, then.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their\\\\nshoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid irritably, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ctry an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 get a straight answer out of a\\\\ncentaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 closer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99n the moon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre there many of them in here?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Hermione.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, a fair few\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re\\\\ngood enough about turnin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 up if ever I want a word. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re deep, mind,\\\\ncentaurs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6they know things\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6jus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 let on much.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cD\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nbin killin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the unicorns \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 never heard anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 like it before.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking\\\\nnervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched.\\\\nHe was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just\\\\npassed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arm.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou two wait here!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid shouted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStay on the path, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll come back\\\\nfor yeh!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood\\\\nlooking at each other, very scared, until they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t hear anything but the\\\\nrustling of leaves around them.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been hurt, do you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d whispered Hermione.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t care if Malfoy has, but if something\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s our fault\\\\nhe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s here in the first place.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nseemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was\\\\ngoing on? Where were the others?\\\\nAt last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s return. Malfoy,\\\\nNeville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had\\\\nsneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and\\\\nsent up the sparks.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be lucky ter catch anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 now, with the racket you two were\\\\nmakin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99. Right, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re changin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 groups \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Neville, you stay with me an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\nHermione, Harry, you go with Fang an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 this idiot. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sorry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid added in a\\\\nwhisper to Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have a harder time frightenin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve gotta\\\\nget this done.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nSo Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They\\\\nwalked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path\\\\nbecame almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry\\\\nthought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots\\\\nof a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by.\\\\nHarry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient\\\\noak.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.\\\\nSomething bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.\\\\nIt was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen\\\\nanything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles\\\\n\\\\nwhere it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.\\\\nHarry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him\\\\nfreeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6Then, out\\\\nof the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some\\\\nstalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure\\\\nreached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s side, and\\\\nbegan to drink its blood.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAAAAAAAAAARGH!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nMalfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 so did Fang. The hooded\\\\nfigure raised its head and looked right at Harry \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 unicorn blood was dribbling\\\\ndown its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nmove for fear.\\\\nThen a pain like he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though\\\\nhis scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves\\\\nbehind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the\\\\nfigure.\\\\nThe pain in Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute\\\\nor two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing\\\\nover him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair\\\\nand a palomino body.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre you all right?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 thank you \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 what was that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe centaur didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale\\\\nsapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood\\\\nout, livid, on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s forehead.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are the Potter boy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou had better get back to Hagrid.\\\\nThe forest is not safe at this time \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 especially for you. Can you ride? It will be\\\\nquicker this way.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy name is Firenze,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he added, as he lowered himself on to his front\\\\nlegs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.\\\\nThere was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the\\\\nclearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving\\\\nand sweaty.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFirenze!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Bane thundered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are you doing? You have a human on\\\\nyour back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you realize who this is?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Firenze. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is the Potter boy. The\\\\nquicker he leaves this forest, the better.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat have you been telling him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d growled Bane. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRemember, Firenze,\\\\nwe are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is\\\\n\\\\nto come in the movements of the planets?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRonan pawed the ground nervously. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sure Firenze thought he was\\\\nacting for the best, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c he said in his gloomy voice.\\\\nBane kicked his back legs in anger.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFor the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with\\\\nwhat has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after\\\\nstray humans in our forest!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nFirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to\\\\ngrab his shoulders to stay on.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you not see that unicorn?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Firenze bellowed at Bane. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you not\\\\nunderstand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I\\\\nset myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans\\\\nalongside me if I must.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAnd Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could,\\\\nthey plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.\\\\nHarry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have a clue what was going on.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Bane so angry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat was that thing you saved me\\\\nfrom, anyway?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nFirenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case\\\\nof low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s question. They made their\\\\nway through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nwant to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense\\\\npatch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, startled by the odd question. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve only used the horn\\\\nand tail hair in Potions.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Firenze.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOnly one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a\\\\ncrime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from\\\\ndeath, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to\\\\nsave yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment\\\\nthe blood touches your lips.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry stared at the back of Firenze\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head, which was dappled silver in\\\\nthe moonlight.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be that desperate?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he wondered aloud. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to\\\\nbe cursed forever, death\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s better, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Firenze agreed, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cunless all you need is to stay alive long enough\\\\nto drink something else \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 something that will bring you back to full strength\\\\nand power \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 something that will mean you can never die. Mr Potter, do you\\\\n\\\\nknow what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone! Of course \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 the Elixir of Life! But I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nunderstand who \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power,\\\\nwho has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heart.\\\\nOver the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told\\\\nhim on the night they had met: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSome say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion.\\\\nDunno if he had enough human left in him to die.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you mean,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry croaked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat was Vol-\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry! Harry, are you all right?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along\\\\nbehind her.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m fine,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe\\\\nunicorn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dead, Hagrid, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s in that clearing back there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is where I leave you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to\\\\nexamine the unicorn. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are safe now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry slid off his back.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood luck, Harry Potter,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Firenze. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe planets have been read\\\\nwrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry\\\\nshivering behind him.\\\\nRon had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return.\\\\nHe shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him\\\\nawake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell\\\\nhim and Hermione what had happened in the forest.\\\\nHarry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He\\\\nwas still shaking.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape wants the stone for Voldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6and Voldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s waiting in the\\\\nforest\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStop saying the name!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought\\\\nVoldemort could hear them.\\\\nHarry wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t listening.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFirenze saved me, but he shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have done so.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6Bane was furious\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\nhe was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to\\\\nhappen\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.They must show that Voldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coming back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6Bane thinks Firenze\\\\nshould have let Voldemort kill me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6I suppose that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s written in the stars as well.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWill you stop saying the name!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron hissed.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo all I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry went\\\\non feverishly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthen Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off ... Well, I\\\\nsuppose Bane\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be happy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry, everyone says Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the only one You-Know-Who was\\\\never afraid of with Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t touch you.\\\\nAnyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me,\\\\nand Professor McGonagall says that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a very imprecise branch of magic.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed\\\\nexhausted, their throats sore. But the night\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s surprises weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t over.\\\\nWhen Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded\\\\nneatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:\\\\nJust in case.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed\\\\nto get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting\\\\nthrough the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no\\\\ndoubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.\\\\nIt was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did\\\\ntheir written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams,\\\\nwhich had been bewitched with an Anticheating spell.\\\\nThey had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by\\\\none into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk.\\\\nProfessor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 points\\\\nwere given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers.\\\\nSnape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to\\\\nremember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.\\\\nHarry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his\\\\nforehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest.\\\\nNeville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nsleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare,\\\\nexcept that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure\\\\ndripping blood in it.\\\\nMaybe it was because they hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seen what Harry had seen in the forest,\\\\nor because they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and\\\\nHermione didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of\\\\nVoldemort certainly scared them, but he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t keep visiting them in dreams, and\\\\nthey were so busy with their studying they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have much time to fret about\\\\nwhat Snape or anyone else might be up to.\\\\nTheir very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering\\\\nquestions about batty old wizards who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d invented selfstirring cauldrons and\\\\nthey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came\\\\nout. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and\\\\nroll up their parchment, Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help cheering with the rest.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat was far easier than I thought it would be,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione as they\\\\njoined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI needn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have learned\\\\n\\\\nabout the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but\\\\nRon said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped\\\\nunder a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a\\\\ngiant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo more studying,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron\\\\nsighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou could look more cheerful,\\\\nHarry, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got a week before we find out how badly we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve done, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no\\\\nneed to worry yet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry was rubbing his forehead.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI wish I knew what this means!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he burst out angrily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy scar keeps\\\\nhurting \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s happened before, but never as often as this.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo to Madam Pomfrey,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione suggested.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not ill,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a warning\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6it means danger\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\ncoming\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get worked up, it was too hot.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry, relax, Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s right, the Stone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s safe as long as Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\naround. Anyway, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past\\\\nFluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not going to try it again in a\\\\nhurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets\\\\nDumbledore down.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry nodded, but he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t shake off a lurking feeling that there was\\\\nsomething he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain\\\\nthis, Hermione said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just the exams. I woke up last night and was\\\\nhalfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d done that\\\\none.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have anything to do with\\\\nwork, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue\\\\nsky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him\\\\nletters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone\\\\nhow to get past Fluffy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6never\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6but\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.\\\\nHarry suddenly jumped to his feet.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re you going?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron sleepily.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve just thought of something,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. He had turned white.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you think it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a bit odd,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, scrambling up the grassy\\\\nslope, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a\\\\nstranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many\\\\npeople wander around with dragon eggs if it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s against wizard law? Lucky they\\\\n\\\\nfound Hagrid, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you think? Why didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t I see it before?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are you talking about?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the\\\\ngrounds toward the forest, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t answer.\\\\nHagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and\\\\nsleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHullo,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, smiling. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFinished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, please,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, but Harry cut him off.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re in a hurry. Hagrid, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to ask you something. You know\\\\nthat night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with\\\\nlook like?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDunno,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid casually, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9che wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 take his cloak off.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 funny folk in the Hog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Head \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nthat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he? I\\\\nnever saw his face, he kept his hood up.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat did you talk to him\\\\nabout, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMighta come up,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6he asked what I did, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I told him I was gamekeeper here\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6He asked a\\\\nbit about the sorta creatures I took after\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6so I told him\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I said what I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d\\\\nalways really wanted was a dragon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 then\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 remember too well, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98cause\\\\nhe kept buyin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 me drinks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6Let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s see\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg\\\\nan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 we could play cards fer it if I wanted\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6but he had ter be sure I could handle\\\\nit, he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 want it ter go ter any old home\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon\\\\nwould be easy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd did he \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 did he seem interested in Fluffy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked, trying to\\\\nkeep his voice calm.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 yeah \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 how many three-headed dogs d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99yeh meet, even around\\\\nHogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a piece o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 cake if yeh know how to calm him\\\\ndown, jus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 play him a bit o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 music an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll go straight off ter sleep \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHagrid suddenly looked horrified.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ta told yeh that!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he blurted out. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cForget I said it! Hey \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nwhere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re yeh goin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak to each other at all until they\\\\ncame to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the\\\\ngrounds.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to go to Dumbledore,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid told that stranger\\\\nhow to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nit must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been easy, once he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore\\\\n\\\\nbelieves us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop him. Where\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nDumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s office?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right\\\\ndirection. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know\\\\nanyone who had been sent to see him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll just have to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the\\\\nhall.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are you three doing inside?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe want to see Professor Dumbledore,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione, rather bravely,\\\\nHarry and Ron thought.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee Professor Dumbledore?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Professor McGonagall repeated, as though\\\\nthis was a very fishy thing to want to do. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry swallowed \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 now what?\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sort of secret,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, but he wished at once he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, because\\\\nProfessor McGonagall\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nostrils flared.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProfessor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said coldly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\nreceived an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at\\\\nonce.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry frantically. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProfessor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many\\\\ndemands on his time \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut this is important.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSomething you have to say is more important than the Ministry of\\\\nMagic, Potter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProfessor \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nabout the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nWhatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t that. The books\\\\nshe was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t pick them up.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow do you know \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she spluttered.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProfessor, I think \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I know \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 that Sn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 that someone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to try\\\\nand steal the Stone. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nShe eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProfessor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said finally. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nknow how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly\\\\nsteal it, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s too well protected.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut Professor \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPotter, I know what I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m talking about,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said shortly. She bent down\\\\nand gathered up the fallen books. I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the\\\\n\\\\nsunshine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nBut they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s tonight,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was\\\\nout of earshot. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going through the trapdoor tonight. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s found out\\\\neverything he needs, and now he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that\\\\nnote, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns\\\\nup.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what can we \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.\\\\nSnape was standing there.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood afternoon,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said smoothly.\\\\nThey stared at him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be inside on a day like this,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, with an odd, twisted\\\\nsmile.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe were \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou want to be more careful,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Snape. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHanging around like this,\\\\npeople will think you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re up to something. And Gryffindor really can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t afford to\\\\nlose any more points, can it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBe warned, Potter \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 any more nighttime wanderings and I will\\\\npersonally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe strode off in the direction of the staffroom.\\\\nOut on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRight, here\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to do,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he whispered urgently. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne of us\\\\nhas got to keep an eye on Snape \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 wait outside the staff room and follow him if\\\\nhe leaves it. Hermione, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better do that.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s obvious,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can pretend to be waiting for Professor\\\\nFlitwick, you know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He put on a high voice, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Oh Professor Flitwick, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m so\\\\nworried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, shut up,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for\\\\nSnape.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry told Ron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome on.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nBut that part of the plan didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t work. No sooner had they reached the\\\\ndoor separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall\\\\nturned up again and this time, she lost her temper.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose you think you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re harder to get past than a pack of\\\\nenchantments!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she stormed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEnough of this nonsense! If I hear you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve come\\\\n\\\\nanywhere near here again, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes,\\\\nWeasley, from my own house!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt\\\\nleast Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s on Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s tail,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open\\\\nand Hermione came in.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sorry, Harry!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she wailed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape came out and asked me what I\\\\nwas doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and\\\\nI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve only just got away, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know where Snape went.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s it then, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry said.\\\\nThe other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going out of here tonight and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to try and get to the Stone\\\\nfirst.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re mad!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAfter what McGonagall and Snape have\\\\nsaid? You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be expelled!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSO WHAT\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry shouted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you understand? If Snape gets hold\\\\nof the Stone, Voldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coming back! Haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you heard what it was like\\\\nwhen he was trying to take over? There won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be any Hogwarts to get expelled\\\\nfrom! He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points\\\\ndoesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t matter anymore, can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you see? D\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99you think he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll leave you and your\\\\nfamilies alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get\\\\nto the Stone, well, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to\\\\nfind me there, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m never\\\\ngoing over to the Dark Side! I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing\\\\nyou two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe glared at them.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re right Harry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione in a small voice.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll use the invisibility cloak,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just lucky I got it back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut will it cover all three of us?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 all three of us?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, come off it, you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d let you go alone?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf course not,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione briskly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow do you think you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d get to\\\\nthe Stone without us? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better go and took through my books, there might be\\\\nsomething useful\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot if I can help it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione grimly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFlitwick told me in secret\\\\nthat I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not throwing me\\\\nout after that.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nAfter dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room.\\\\nNobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry\\\\nany more, after all. This was the first night he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been upset by it. Hermione\\\\nwas skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the\\\\nenchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t talk much.\\\\nBoth of them were thinking about what they were about to do.\\\\nSlowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBetter get the cloak,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left,\\\\nstretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out\\\\nthe cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas.\\\\nHe pocketed it to use on Fluffy \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel much like singing.\\\\nHe ran back down to the common room.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are you doing?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville\\\\nappeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as\\\\nthough he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been making another bid for freedom.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing, Neville, nothing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak\\\\nbehind his back.\\\\nNeville stared at their guilty faces.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going out again,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no, no,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not. Why don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you go to bed,\\\\nNeville?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t afford\\\\nto waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go out,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Neville, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be caught again. Gryffindor will\\\\nbe in even more trouble.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t understand,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthis is important.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nBut Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.\\\\nI won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t let you do it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait\\\\nhole. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll fight you!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNeville, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRon exploded, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cget away from that hole and don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be an idiot\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you call me an idiot!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Neville. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think you should be\\\\nbreaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to\\\\npeople!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, but not to us,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron in exasperation. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNeville, you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know\\\\nwhat you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re doing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt\\\\n\\\\nout of sight.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo on then, try and hit me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Neville, raising his fists. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m ready!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry turned to Hermione.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo something,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said desperately.\\\\nHermione stepped forward.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNeville,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m really, really sorry about this.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nShe raised her wand.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPetrificus Totalus!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she cried, pointing it at Neville.\\\\nNeville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole\\\\nbody rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a\\\\nboard.\\\\nHermione ran to turn him over. Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s jaws were jammed together so\\\\nhe couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve you done to him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry whispered.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the full Body-Bind,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione miserably. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, Neville, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m so\\\\nsorry.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe had to, Neville, no time to explain,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll understand later, Neville,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron as they stepped over him and\\\\npulled on the invisibility cloak.\\\\nBut leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel like a very\\\\ngood omen. In their nervous state, every statue\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shadow looked like Filch, every\\\\ndistant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot\\\\nof the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs Norris skulking near the top.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s kick her, just this once,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron whispered in Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ear, but\\\\nHarry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs Norris turned\\\\nher lamplike eyes on them, but didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do anything.\\\\nThey didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the\\\\nthird floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people\\\\nwould trip.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He\\\\nnarrowed his wicked black eyes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKnow you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re there, even if I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see you.\\\\nAre you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShould call Filch, I should, if something\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a-creeping around unseen.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry had a sudden idea.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPeeves,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, in a hoarse whisper, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe Bloody Baron has his own\\\\nreasons for being invisible.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nPeeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and\\\\nhovered about a foot off the stairs.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo sorry, your bloodiness, Mr Baron, Sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said greasily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy\\\\nmistake, my mistake \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see you \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 of course I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re invisible \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nforgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have business here, Peeves,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d croaked Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStay away from this\\\\nplace tonight.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will, sir, I most certainly will,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Peeves, rising up in the air again.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHope your business goes well, Baron, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll not bother you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAnd he scooted off.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBrilliant, Harry!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d whispered Ron.\\\\nA few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nand the door was already ajar.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, there you are,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry said quietly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s already got past\\\\nFluffy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nSeeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them\\\\nwhat was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you want to go back, I won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blame you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can take the\\\\ncloak, I won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t need it now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be stupid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re coming,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione.\\\\nHarry pushed the door open.\\\\nAs the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the\\\\ndog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see them.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that at its feet?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione whispered.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLooks like a harp,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape must have left it there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt must wake up the moment you stop playing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, here\\\\ngoes \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe put Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t really a tune, but\\\\nfrom the first note the beast\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath.\\\\nSlowly, the dog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s growls ceased \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees,\\\\nthen it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKeep playing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and\\\\ncrept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hot, smelly breath as they\\\\napproached the giant heads. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be able to pull the door open,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\nRon, peering over the dog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s back. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWant to go first, Hermione?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nlegs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat can you see?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione said anxiously.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 just black \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no way of climbing down, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll just\\\\n\\\\nhave to drop.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention\\\\nand pointed at himself.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou want to go first? Are you sure?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know how deep\\\\nthis thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry handed the flute over. In the few seconds\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 silence, the dog growled\\\\nand twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep\\\\nsleep.\\\\nHarry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was\\\\nno sign of the bottom.\\\\nHe lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his\\\\nfingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf anything happens to me, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nfollow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRight,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee you in a minute, I hope \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAnd Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down,\\\\ndown and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nFLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something\\\\nsoft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though\\\\nhe was sitting on some sort of plant.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s okay!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which\\\\nwas the open trapdoor, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a soft landing, you can jump!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s this stuff?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d were his first words.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s here to break the fall.\\\\nCome on, Hermione!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but\\\\nHermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s other side.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe must be miles under the school,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLucky this plant thing\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s here, really,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLucky!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shrieked Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook at you both!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nShe leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle\\\\nbecause the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike\\\\ntendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been\\\\nbound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.\\\\nHermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on\\\\nher. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them,\\\\nbut the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound\\\\naround them.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStop moving!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione ordered them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know what this is \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nDevil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Snare!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m so glad we know what it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s called, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a great help,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d snarled\\\\nRon, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShut\\\\nup, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m trying to remember how to kill it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, hurry up, I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t breathe!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it\\\\ncurled around his chest.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDevil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Snare, Devil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Snare\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6what did Professor Sprout say? \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it likes\\\\nthe dark and the damp.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo light a fire!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry choked.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 of course \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 but there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no wood!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione cried, wringing her\\\\nhands.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHAVE YOU GONE MAD?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron bellowed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cARE YOU A WITCH OR\\\\nNOT?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, right!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it,\\\\nmuttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on\\\\nSnape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip\\\\nas it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it\\\\nunraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry as he\\\\njoined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand lucky Harry doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t lose his head in a crisis \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no wood,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 honestly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis way,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was\\\\nthe only way forward.\\\\nAll they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water\\\\ntrickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was\\\\nreminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the\\\\ndragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 bank. If they met a dragon, a\\\\nfully-grown dragon \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Norbert had been bad enough\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan you hear something?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron whispered.\\\\nHarry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up\\\\nahead.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you think it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a ghost?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6sounds like wings to me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s light ahead \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I can see something moving.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a\\\\nbrilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small,\\\\njewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite\\\\n\\\\nside of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you think they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll attack us if we cross the room?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProbably,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look very vicious, but I suppose if\\\\nthey all swooped down at once\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6well, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no other choice\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll run.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted\\\\nacross the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any\\\\nsecond, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the\\\\nhandle, but it was locked.\\\\nThe other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it\\\\nwouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThese birds\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6they can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be here just for decoration,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione.\\\\nThey watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 glittering?\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not birds!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry said suddenly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re keys! Winged keys\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 look carefully. So that must mean\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he looked around the chamber while the\\\\nother two squinted up at the flock of keys. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6yes \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 look! Broomsticks! We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve\\\\ngot to catch the key to the door!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut there are hundreds of them!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon examined the lock on the door.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re looking for a big, old-fashioned one \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 probably silver, like the\\\\nhandle.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into\\\\nthe midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched\\\\nkeys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.\\\\nNot for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He\\\\nhad a knack for spotting things other people didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. After a minute\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s weaving\\\\nabout through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that\\\\nhad a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the\\\\nkeyhole.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat one!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he called to the others. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat big one \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 there \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 no, there\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 with bright blue wings \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into\\\\nthe ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to close in on it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key\\\\nwith the damaged wing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRon, you come at it from above \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Hermione, stay\\\\nbelow and stop it from going down and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and\\\\nHarry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a\\\\nnasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and\\\\n\\\\nHermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cheers echoed around the high chamber.\\\\nThey landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his\\\\nhand. He rammed it into the lock and turned \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 it worked. The moment the lock\\\\nhad clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had\\\\nbeen caught twice.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cReady?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They\\\\nnodded. He pulled the door open.\\\\nThe next chamber was so dark they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see anything at all. But as\\\\nthey stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing\\\\nsight.\\\\nThey were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black\\\\nchessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like\\\\nblack stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry,\\\\nRon and Hermione shivered slightly \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 the towering white chessmen had no\\\\nfaces.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow what do we do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry whispered.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s obvious, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to play our way across the\\\\nroom.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nBehind the white pieces they could see another door.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione nervously.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to have to be chessmen.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nhorse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the\\\\nknight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo we \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 er \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 have to join you to get across?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The black knight\\\\nnodded. Ron turned to the other two.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis needs thinking about\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to take the\\\\nplace of three of the black pieces\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said,\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not offended,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry quickly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust tell us what to do.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you next\\\\nto him instead of that castle.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat about you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to be a knight,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron.\\\\nThe chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a\\\\nknight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked\\\\noff the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhite always plays first in chess,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, peering across the board.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6look\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nA white pawn had moved forward two squares.\\\\nRon started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he\\\\nsent them. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s knees were trembling. What if they lost?\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 move diagonally four squares to the right.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nTheir first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white\\\\nqueen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay\\\\nquite still, facedown.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHad to let that happen,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, looking shaken. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLeaves you free to\\\\ntake that bishop, Hermione, go on.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nEvery time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.\\\\nSoon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice,\\\\nRon only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He\\\\nhimself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had\\\\nlost black ones.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re nearly there,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he muttered suddenly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet me think \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 let me\\\\nthink\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe white queen turned her blank face toward him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron softly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the only way\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to be taken.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNO!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry and Hermione shouted.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s chess!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d snapped Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to make some sacrifices! I\\\\ntake one step forward and she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll take me \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 that leaves you free to checkmate\\\\nthe king, Harry!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you want to stop Snape or not?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRon \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook, if you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t hurry up, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll already have the Stone!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThere was no alternative.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cReady?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron called, his face pale but determined. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere I go \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 now,\\\\ndon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t hang around once you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve won.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard\\\\nacross the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Hermione\\\\nscreamed but stayed on her square \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 the white queen dragged Ron to one side.\\\\nHe looked as if he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been knocked out.\\\\nShaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.\\\\nThe white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s feet. They had\\\\nwon. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one\\\\nlast desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door\\\\n\\\\nand up the next passageway.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat if he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be all right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, trying to convince himself. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do you\\\\nreckon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s next?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had Sprout\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, that was the Devil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Snare; Flitwick must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve put\\\\ncharms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive;\\\\nthat leaves Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s spell, and Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey had reached another door.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry whispered.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo on.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry pushed it open.\\\\nA disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their\\\\nrobes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of\\\\nthem, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody\\\\nlump on its head.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m glad we didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have to fight that one,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry whispered as they\\\\nstepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome on, I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t breathe.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what\\\\ncame next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with\\\\nseven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do we have to do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind\\\\nthem in the doorway. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same\\\\ninstant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry\\\\nlooked over her shoulder to read it:\\\\nDanger lies before you, while safety lies behind,\\\\nTwo of us will help you, which ever you would find,\\\\nOne among us seven will let you move ahead,\\\\nAnother will transport the drinker back instead,\\\\nTwo among our number hold only nettle wine,\\\\nThree of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.\\\\nChoose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,\\\\nTo help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:\\\\nFirst, however slyly the poison tries to hide\\\\nYou will always find some on nettle wine\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s left side;\\\\nSecond, different are those who stand at either end,\\\\nBut if you would move onward, neither is your friend;\\\\n\\\\nThird, as you see clearly, all are different size,\\\\nNeither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;\\\\nFourth, the second left and the second on the right\\\\nAre twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.\\\\nHermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling,\\\\nthe very last thing he felt like doing.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBrilliant,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t magic \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s logic \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 a puzzle. A\\\\nlot of the greatest wizards haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got an ounce of logic, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be stuck in here\\\\nforever.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut so will we, won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t we?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf course not,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEverything we need is here on this\\\\npaper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely\\\\nthrough the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut how do we know which to drink?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGive me a minute.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down\\\\nthe line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped\\\\nher hands.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGot it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe smallest bottle will get us through the black\\\\nfire \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 toward the Stone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry looked at the tiny bottle.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s only enough there for one of us,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hardly one\\\\nswallow.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThey looked at each other.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhich one will get you back through the purple flames?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou drink that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab\\\\nbrooms from the flying-key room, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get you out of the trapdoor and past\\\\nFluffy \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need\\\\nhim. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m no match for him,\\\\nreally.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut Harry \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 what if You-Know-Who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s with him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I was lucky once, wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t I?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, pointing at his scar. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\nmight get lucky again.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her\\\\narms around him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHermione!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re a great wizard, you know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not as good as you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of\\\\nhim.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMe!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBooks! And cleverness! There are more\\\\nimportant things \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 friendship and bravery and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 oh Harry \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 be careful!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou drink first,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are sure which is which, aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPositive,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at\\\\nthe end, and shuddered.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not poison?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry anxiously.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 but it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s like ice.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuick, go, before it wears off.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood luck \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 take care.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGO!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.\\\\nHarry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to\\\\nface the black flames.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere I come,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.\\\\nIt was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle\\\\ndown and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his\\\\nbody, but couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel them \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.\\\\nThere was already someone there \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 but it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t Snape. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even\\\\nVoldemort.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIt was Quirrell.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d gasped Harry.\\\\nQuirrell smiled. His face wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t twitching at all.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMe,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said calmly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI wondered whether I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be meeting you here,\\\\nPotter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I thought \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Snape \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSeverus?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Quirrell laughed, and it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t his usual quivering treble,\\\\neither, but cold and sharp. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, Severus does seem the type, doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he? So\\\\nuseful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who\\\\nwould suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t take it in. This couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be true, it couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut Snape tried to kill me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally\\\\nknocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She\\\\nbroke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have got you off\\\\nthat broom. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have managed it before then if Snape hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been muttering a\\\\ncountercurse, trying to save you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape was trying to save me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf course,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Quirrell coolly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy do you think he wanted to\\\\nreferee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do it again. Funny,\\\\nreally\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6he needn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have bothered. I couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do anything with Dumbledore\\\\nwatching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor\\\\nfrom winning, he did make himself unpopular\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6and what a waste of time, when\\\\nafter all that, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to kill you tonight.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nQuirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped\\\\nthemselves tightly around Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on\\\\nHalloween like that, for all I knew you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d seen me coming to look at what was\\\\nguarding the Stone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou let the troll in?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCertainly. I have a special gift with trolls \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 you must have seen what I\\\\ndid to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else\\\\n\\\\nwas running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went\\\\nstraight to the third floor to head me off \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and not only did my troll fail to beat\\\\nyou to death, that three-headed dog didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even manage to bite Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s leg off\\\\nproperly.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It\\\\nwas the Mirror of Erised.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Quirrell murmured, tapping\\\\nhis way around the frame. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTrust Dumbledore to come up with something like\\\\nthis\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6but he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s in London\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be far away by the time he gets back\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAll Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him\\\\nfrom concentrating on the mirror.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI saw you and Snape in the forest \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he blurted out.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d got. He suspected\\\\nme all along. Tried to frighten me \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 as though he could, when I had Lord\\\\nVoldemort on my side\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nQuirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see the Stone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m presenting it to my master\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6but where is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t give. He\\\\nhad to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, he does,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Quirrell casually, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cheavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts\\\\nwith your father, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you know? They loathed each other. But he never\\\\nwanted you dead.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I heard you a few days ago, sobbing \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I thought Snape was\\\\nthreatening you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nFor the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSometimes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI find it hard to follow my master\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s instructions\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he is a great wizard and I am weak \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou mean he was there in the classroom with you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry gasped.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is with me wherever I go,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Quirrell quietly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI met him when I\\\\ntraveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous\\\\nideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There\\\\nis no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6Since\\\\nthen, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He\\\\nhas had to be very hard on me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Quirrell shivered suddenly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe does not forgive\\\\nmistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most\\\\ndispleased. He punished me\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6decided he would have to keep a closer watch on\\\\n\\\\nme.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nQuirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon\\\\nAlley \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 how could he have been so stupid? He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d seen Quirrell there that very\\\\nday, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.\\\\nQuirrell cursed under his breath.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t understand\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mind was racing.\\\\nWhat I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he\\\\nthought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I\\\\nshould see myself finding it \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 which means I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll see where it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hidden! But how\\\\ncan I look without Quirrell realizing what I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m up to?\\\\nHe tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell\\\\nnoticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over.\\\\nQuirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAnd to Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come\\\\nfrom Quirrell himself.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUse the boy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6Use the boy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nQuirrell rounded on Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Potter \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 come here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry\\\\ngot slowly to his feet.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome here,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Quirrell repeated. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook in the mirror and tell me what\\\\nyou see.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry walked toward him.\\\\nI must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see,\\\\nthat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all.\\\\nQuirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that\\\\nseemed to come from Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of\\\\nthe mirror, and opened them again.\\\\nHe saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment\\\\nlater, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a\\\\nblood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and as it did\\\\nso, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 incredibly\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d gotten the Stone.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Quirrell impatiently. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do you see?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry screwed up his courage.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he invented. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve\\\\nwon the house cup for Gryffindor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nQuirrell cursed again.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGet out of the way,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the\\\\nSorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?\\\\nBut he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though\\\\nQuirrell wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t moving his lips.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe lies\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6He lies.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPotter, come back here!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Quirrell shouted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTell me the truth! What did\\\\nyou just see?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe high voice spoke again.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet me speak to him\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6face-to-face\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMaster, you are not strong enough!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have strength enough\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6for this\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry felt as if Devil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nmove a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to\\\\nunwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head\\\\nlooked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.\\\\nHarry would have screamed, but he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make a sound. Where there\\\\nshould have been a back to Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head, there was a face, the most terrible\\\\nface Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for\\\\nnostrils, like a snake.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d it whispered.\\\\nHarry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t move.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee what I have become?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the face said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMere shadow and vapor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.I\\\\nhave form only when I can share another\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s body\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6but there have always been\\\\nthose willing to let me into their hearts and minds\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6Unicorn blood has\\\\nstrengthened me, these past weeks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me\\\\nin the forest\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body\\\\nof my own\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.Now\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6why don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you give me that Stone in your pocket?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nSo he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s legs. He\\\\nstumbled backward.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be a fool,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d snarled the face. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBetter save your own life and join\\\\nme\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6or you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll meet the same end as your parents\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6They died begging me for\\\\nmercy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLIAR!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry shouted suddenly.\\\\nQuirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see\\\\nhim. The evil face was now smiling.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow touching\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d it hissed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI always value bravery\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.Yes, boy, your\\\\nparents were brave\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6I killed your father first; and he put up a courageous\\\\nfight\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6but your mother needn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have died\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6she was trying to protect you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6Now\\\\n\\\\ngive me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNEVER!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSEIZE\\\\nHIM!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand close on his wrist. At\\\\nonce, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s scar; his head felt as though it\\\\nwas about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his\\\\nsurprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he looked\\\\naround wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain,\\\\nlooking at his fingers \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 they were blistering before his eyes.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSeize him! SEIZE HIM!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell\\\\nlunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet landing on top of him, both hands\\\\naround Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s neck \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he\\\\ncould see Quirrell howling in agony.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMaster, I cannot hold him \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 my hands \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 my hands!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAnd Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go\\\\nof his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Harry could see they\\\\nlooked burned, raw, red, and shiny.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen kill him, fool, and be done!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d screeched Voldemort.\\\\nQuirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct,\\\\nreached up and grabbed Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAAAARGH!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nQuirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew:\\\\nQuirrell couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 his\\\\nonly chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him\\\\nfrom doing a curse.\\\\nHarry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight\\\\nas he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 the pain in\\\\nHarry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head was building \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he could only hear Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nterrible shrieks and Voldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s yells of, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKILL HIM! KILL HIM!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and other\\\\nvoices, maybe in Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s own head, crying, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry! Harry!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe felt Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and\\\\nfell into blackness, down\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6down\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6 down\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.\\\\nSomething gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it,\\\\nbut his arms were too heavy.\\\\nHe blinked. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How\\\\nstrange.\\\\nHe blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into\\\\nview above him.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood afternoon, Harry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore.\\\\nHarry stared at him. Then he remembered: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSir! The Stone! It was\\\\nQuirrell! He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got the Stone! Sir, quick \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCalm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said\\\\nDumbledore. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuirrell does not have the Stone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen who does? Sir, I \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the\\\\nhospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him\\\\nwas a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTokens from your friends and admirers,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore, beaming.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a\\\\ncomplete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends\\\\nMisters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet\\\\nseat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt\\\\nit might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow long have I been in here?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThree days. Mr Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most\\\\nrelieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut sir, the Stone \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor\\\\nQuirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that,\\\\nalthough you were doing very well on your own, I must say.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou got there? You got Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s owl?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than\\\\nit became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I\\\\narrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI feared I might be too late.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou nearly were, I couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have kept him off the Stone much longer \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot the Stone, boy, you \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 the effort involved nearly killed you. For one\\\\nterrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been\\\\ndestroyed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDestroyed?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry blankly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut your friend \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Nicolas Flamel \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, you know about Nicolas?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore, sounding quite\\\\ndelighted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou did do the thing properly, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you? Well, Nicolas and I have\\\\nhad a little chat, and agreed it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all for the best.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut that means he and his wife will die, won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t they?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes,\\\\n\\\\nthey will die.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nDumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo one as young as you, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and\\\\nPerenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the\\\\nwell-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone\\\\nwas really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could\\\\nwant! The two things most human beings would choose above all \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 the trouble\\\\nis, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for\\\\nthem.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled\\\\nat the ceiling.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSir?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been thinking\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6sir \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 even if the Stone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone,\\\\nVol-, I mean, You-Know-Who \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCall him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear\\\\nof a name increases fear of the thing itself.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir. Well, Voldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to try other ways of coming back, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nhe? I mean, he hasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t gone, has he?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking\\\\nfor another body to share\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left\\\\nQuirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies.\\\\nNevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it\\\\nwill merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing\\\\nbattle next time \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never\\\\nreturn to power.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then\\\\nhe said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSir, there are some other things I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like to know, if you can tell me\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\nthings I want to know the truth about.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe truth.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dumbledore sighed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a beautiful and terrible thing, and\\\\nshould therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your\\\\nquestions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll\\\\nforgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried\\\\nto stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first\\\\nplace?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nDumbledore sighed very deeply this time.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAlas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now.\\\\nYou will know, one day\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are\\\\nolder\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6I know you hate to hear this\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6when you are ready, you will know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAnd Harry knew it would be no good to argue.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut why couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t Quirrell touch me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot\\\\nunderstand, it is love. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t realize that love as powerful as your mother\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nfor you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6to have been loved so\\\\ndeeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some\\\\nprotection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and\\\\nambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It\\\\nwas agony to touch a person marked by something so good.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nDumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill,\\\\nwhich gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice\\\\nagain, Harry said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd the invisibility cloak \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 do you know who sent it to\\\\nme?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought\\\\nyou might like it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes twinkled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUseful things\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6your father\\\\nused it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s something else\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFire away.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuirrell said Snape \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProfessor Snape, Harry.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, him \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that\\\\ntrue?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr\\\\nMalfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe saved his life.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore dreamily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFunny, the way people\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s minds\\\\nwork, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it? Professor Snape couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t bear being in your father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s debt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6I do\\\\nbelieve he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would\\\\nmake him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nmemory in peace.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd sir, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s one more thing\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust the one?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow did I get the Stone out of the mirror?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, now, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant\\\\nideas, and between you and me, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s saying something. You see, only one who\\\\nwanted to find the Stone \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 find it, but not use it \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 would be able to get it,\\\\notherwise they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My\\\\n\\\\nbrain surprises even me sometimes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6Now, enough questions. I suggest you\\\\nmake a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Every Flavor Beans! I was\\\\nunfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since\\\\nthen I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m afraid I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve rather lost my liking for them \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 but I think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be safe with\\\\na nice toffee, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he\\\\nchoked and said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAlas! Ear wax!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nMadam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust five minutes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry pleaded.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbsolutely not.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou let Professor Dumbledore in\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam\\\\nPomfrey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, very well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut five minutes only.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAnd she let Ron and Hermione in.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry\\\\nwas glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, Harry, we were sure you were going to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 Dumbledore was so\\\\nworried \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe whole school\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s talking about it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat really\\\\nhappened?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more\\\\nstrange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell;\\\\nthe mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good\\\\naudience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was\\\\nunder Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo the Stone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron finally. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFlamel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just going to die?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 what was it? \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98to\\\\nthe well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI always said he was off his rocker,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, looking quite impressed\\\\nat how crazy his hero was.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo what happened to you two?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I got back all right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI brought Ron round \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 that\\\\ntook a while \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore\\\\nwhen we met him in the entrance hall \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he already knew \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 he just said,\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone after him, hasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and hurtled off to the third floor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cD\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99you think he meant you to do it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSending you your\\\\nfather\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cloak and everything?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione exploded, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cif he did \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I mean to say that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s terrible \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nyou could have been killed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, it isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry thoughtfully. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a funny man, Dumbledore. I\\\\nthink he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less\\\\neverything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we\\\\nwere going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I\\\\ndon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s\\\\nalmost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah, Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s off his rocker, all right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron proudly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cListen,\\\\nyou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and\\\\nSlytherin won, of course \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 you missed the last Quidditch match, we were\\\\nsteamrollered by Ravenclaw without you \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 but the food\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be good.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAt that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said firmly.\\\\nAfter a good night\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.\\\\nI want to go to the feast,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his\\\\nmany candy boxes. I can, can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t I?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProfessor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said\\\\nstiffly, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t realize how risky\\\\nfeasts could be. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you have another visitor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, good,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was\\\\nindoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took\\\\none look at him, and burst into tears.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 all \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 my \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 ruddy \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 fault!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he sobbed, his face in his hands. I\\\\ntold the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he\\\\ndidn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I told him! Yeh could\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve died! All fer a dragon egg! I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll never\\\\ndrink again! I should be chucked out an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 made ter live as a Muggle!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and\\\\nremorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have found out\\\\nsomehow, this is Voldemort we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re talking about, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have found out even if you\\\\nhadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t told him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeh could\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve died!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d sobbed Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 say the name!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVOLDEMORT!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he\\\\nstopped crying. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve met him and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m calling him by his name. Please cheer up,\\\\nHagrid, we saved the Stone, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone, he can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t use it. Have a Chocolate Frog,\\\\n\\\\nI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got loads.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat reminds\\\\nme. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got yeh a present.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not a stoat sandwich, is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid\\\\ngave a weak chuckle.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x98course, he\\\\nshoulda sacked me instead \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 anyway, got yeh this.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it\\\\ncuriously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from\\\\nevery page were his mother and father.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSent owls off ter all yer parents\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 old school friends, askin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fer photos\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\nknew yeh didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 have any\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99yeh like it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHarry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak, but Hagrid understood.\\\\nHarry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had\\\\nbeen held up by Madam Pomfrey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s fussing about, insisting on giving him one\\\\nlast checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the\\\\nSlytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s winning the house\\\\ncup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent\\\\ncovered the wall behind the High Table.\\\\nWhen Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody\\\\nstarted talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione\\\\nat the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up\\\\nto look at him.\\\\nFortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnother year gone!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dumbledore said cheerfully. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd I must trouble\\\\nyou with an old man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our\\\\ndelicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little\\\\nfuller than they were\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and\\\\nempty before next year starts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the\\\\npoints stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve\\\\npoints; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has\\\\nfour hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nA storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table.\\\\nHarry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening\\\\nsight.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHowever, recent\\\\nevents must be taken into account.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\nThe room went very still. The Slytherins\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 smiles faded a little.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAhem,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have a few last-minute points to dish out.\\\\nLet me see. Yes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFirst \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 to Mr Ronald Weasley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nRon went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I\\\\naward Gryffindor house fifty points.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nGryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead\\\\nseemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy brother,\\\\nyou know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s giant chess set!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nAt last there was silence again.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSecond \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 to Miss Hermione Granger\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6for the use of cool logic in the\\\\nface of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had\\\\nburst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\nthey were a hundred points up.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThird \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 to Mr Harry Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore. The room went\\\\ndeadly quiet. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor\\\\nhouse sixty points.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nThe din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling\\\\nthemselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two\\\\npoints \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 if\\\\nonly Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.\\\\nDumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere are all kinds of courage,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore, smiling. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt takes a\\\\ngreat deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to\\\\nour friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr Neville Longbottom.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nSomeone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some\\\\nsort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the\\\\nGryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as\\\\nNeville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He\\\\nhad never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering,\\\\nnudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have looked more\\\\nstunned and horrified if he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhich means,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even\\\\nRavenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwe need\\\\na little change of decoration.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nHe clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet\\\\nand the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering\\\\n\\\\nGryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand,\\\\nwith a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eye and Harry knew at once that\\\\nSnape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s feelings toward him hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t changed one jot. This didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t worry Harry. It\\\\nseemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever\\\\nwas at Hogwarts.\\\\nIt was the best evening of Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s life, better than winning at Quidditch,\\\\nor Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa6he would never, ever forget\\\\ntonight.\\\\nHarry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come\\\\nthey did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks;\\\\nHermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped\\\\nthrough, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They\\\\nhad hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be\\\\nthrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\nhave everything in life.\\\\nAnd suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed,\\\\nNeville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out\\\\nto all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI always hope\\\\nthey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll forget to give us these,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to\\\\ntake them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were\\\\nboarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became\\\\ngreener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past\\\\nMuggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats;\\\\npulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Cross Station.\\\\nIt took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old\\\\nguard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and\\\\nthrees so they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once\\\\nand alarming the Muggles.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou must come and stay this summer,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cboth of you \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll\\\\nsend you an owl.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThanks,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll need something to look forward to.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d People\\\\njostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle\\\\nworld. Some of them called:\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBye, Harry!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee you, Potter!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStill famous,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, grinning at him.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot where I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going, I promise you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry.\\\\nHe, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere he\\\\n\\\\nis, Mom, there he is, look!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt was Ginny Weasley, Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s younger sister, but she wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t pointing at\\\\nRon.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry Potter!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she squealed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook, Mom! I can see \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBe quiet, Ginny, and it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s rude to point.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nMrs Weasley smiled down at them.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBusy year?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs\\\\nWeasley.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, it was nothing, dear.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cReady, are you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\nIt was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking\\\\nfurious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of\\\\nordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at\\\\nthe very sight of Harry.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou must be Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s family!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mrs Weasley.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn a manner of speaking,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHurry up, boy, we\\\\nhaven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got all day.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He walked away.\\\\nHarry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee you over the summer, then.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHope you have \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 er \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x94 a good holiday,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione, looking\\\\nuncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.\\\\n\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, I will,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was\\\\nspreading over his face. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not allowed to use magic at\\\\nhome.

They were the last people you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t hold with such nonsense. Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sister, but they hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t met for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want Dudley mixing with a child like that. When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair. None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window. At half past eight, Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLittle tyke,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s drive. It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr Dursley didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no, looking at the sign; cats couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t read maps or signs. Mr Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt  these people were obviously collecting for something yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d for gotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Potters, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s right, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what I heard  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c   yes, their son, Harry  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Mr Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it. He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blame her   if he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had a sister like that  but all the same, those people in cloaks.  He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSorry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle and walked off. Mr Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t approve of imagination. As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw   and it didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t improve his mood   was the tabby cat he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShoo!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mr Dursley loudly. The cat didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife. Mrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs Next Door\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d). Mr Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The newscaster allowed himself a grin. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMost mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, Ted,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the weatherman, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know about that, but it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters.  Mrs Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr   Petunia, dear   you haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t heard from your sister lately, have you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d As he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have a sister. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said sharply. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFunny stuff on the news,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Mr Dursley mumbled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOwls shooting stars and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d snapped Mrs Dursley. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I just thought maybe it was something to do with you know her crowd.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d heard the name \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPotter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He decided he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTheir son   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be about Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s age now, wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mrs Dursley stiffly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s his name again? Howard, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, yes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, I quite agree.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something. Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did...if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well, he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think he could bear it. The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind....He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t affect them.  How very wrong he was. Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have thought he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just popped out of the ground. The cat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name was Albus Dumbledore. Albus Dumbledore didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI should have known.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs Dursley, they wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow did you know it was me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she asked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear Professor, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be stiff if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been sitting on a brick wall all day,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve celebrating, all right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said impatiently. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d think they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be a bit more careful, but no  even the Muggles have noticed something\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going on. It was on their news.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She jerked her head back at the Dursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dark living-room window. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI heard it. Flocks of owls shooting stars Well, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blame them,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore gently. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall irritably. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, so she went on. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt certainly seems so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA lemon drop. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re a kind of Muggle sweet I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m rather fond of.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, thank you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think this was the moment for lemon drops. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this  You-Know-Who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt all gets so confusing if we keep saying  You-KnowWho.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know you haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re different. Everyone knows you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou flatter me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore calmly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVoldemort had powers I will never have.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOnly because you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re too   well   noble to use them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lucky it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dark. I haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re saying? About why he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ceveryone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re saying,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she pressed on, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cis that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re   dead.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLily and James I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe it I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to believe it Oh, Albus \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know I know \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said heavily.  Professor McGonagall\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice trembled as she went on. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not all. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re saying he tried to kill the Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s son, Harry. But he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re saying that when he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s power somehow broke   and that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dumbledore nodded glumly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s true?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d faltered Professor McGonagall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAfter all he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s done  all the people he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s killed he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t kill a little boy? It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just astounding of all the things to stop him but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe can only guess.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe may never know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s late. I suppose it was he who told you I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be here, by the way?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t suppose you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to tell me why you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re here, of all places?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re the only family he has left now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mean \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mean the people who live here?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDumbledore   you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been watching them all day. You couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t find two people who are less like us. And they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the best place for him,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore firmly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHis aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s older. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve written them a letter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA letter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cReally, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be famous   a legend   I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExactly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt would be enough to turn any boy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even remember! Can you  see how much better off he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be, growing up away from all that until he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ready to take it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes   yes, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s bringing him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI would trust Hagrid with my life,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not saying his heart isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t in the right place,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t pretend he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not careless. He does tend to   what was that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them. If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt last. And where did you get that motorcycle?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBorrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYoung Sirius Black lent it to me. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got him, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo problems, were there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, sir   house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 around. He fell asleep as we was flyin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 over Bristol.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jetblack hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs that where  ?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d whispered Professor McGonagall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have that scar forever.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEven if I could, I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well   give him here, Hagrid   we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better get this over with.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 house. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCould I   could I say good-bye to him, sir?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShhh!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d hissed Professor McGonagall, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll wake the Muggles!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cS-s-sorry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I c-c-can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stand it  Lily an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 James dead   an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, yes, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be found,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes seemed to have gone out. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore finally, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be takin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Sirius his bike back. G\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99night, Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply. Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood luck, Harry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 time by Mrs Dursley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley....He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo Harry Potter   the boy who lived!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d   In early ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets   but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUp! Get up! Now!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUp!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had the same dream before. His aunt was back outside the door. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre you up yet?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she demanded. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNearly,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s birthday.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry groaned. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat did you say?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d his aunt snapped through the door. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing, nothing \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s birthday   how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise   unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t often catch him. Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look it, but he was very fast. Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn the car crash when your parents died,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she had said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ask questions.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ask questions   that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cComb your hair!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he barked, by way of a morning greeting. About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way   all over the place. Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel   Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThirty-six,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, looking up at his mother and father. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s two less than last year.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDarling, you haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t counted Auntie Marge\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s present, see, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s here under this big one from Mummy and Daddy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right, thirty-seven then,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll buy you another two presents while we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re out today. How\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have thirty...thirty...\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThirty-nine, sweetums,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Aunt Petunia. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right then.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Uncle Vernon chuckled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLittle tyke wants his money\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s worth, just like his father. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Atta boy, Dudley!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He ruffled Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hair. At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBad news, Vernon,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMrs Figg\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s broken her leg. She can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t take him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She jerked her head in Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s direction. Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d ever owned. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr Paws, and Tufty again. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe could phone Marge,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Uncle Vernon suggested. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t there   or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t understand them, like a slug. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat about what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s-her-name, your friend   Yvonne?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOn vacation in Majorca,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d snapped Aunt Petunia. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou could just leave me here,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry put in hopefully (he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s computer). Aunt Petunia looked as though she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just swallowed a lemon. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd come back and find the house in ruins?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she snarled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blow up the house,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, but they weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t listening. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose we could take him to the zoo,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Aunt Petunia slowly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c  and leave him in the car. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat car\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s new, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not sitting in it alone. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t really crying   it had been years since he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d really cried   but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDinky Duddydums, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t cry, Mummy won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t let him spoil your special day!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she cried, flinging her arms around him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want him t-t-to come!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe always sp-spoils everything!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arms. Just then, the doorbell rang   \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, good Lord, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re here!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Aunt Petunia frantically   and a moment later, Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m warning you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m warning you now, boy   any funny business, anything at all   and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not going to do anything,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9chonestly \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d But Uncle Vernon didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe him. No one ever did. The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make them happen. Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cto hide that horrible scar.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t explain how it had grown back so quickly. Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t punished. On the other hand, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s surprise as anyone else\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump. But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t school, his cupboard, or Mrs Figg\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cabbage-smelling living room. While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI had a dream about a motorcycle,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, remembering suddenly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was flying.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMOTORCYCLES DON\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99T FLY!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dudley and Piers sniggered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know they don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was only a dream.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d But he wished he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon   they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blond. Harry had the best morning he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s car and crushed it into a trash can   but at the moment it didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMake it move,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t budge. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo it again,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is boring,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself   no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI get that all the time.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sure the snake could hear him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt must be really annoying.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The snake nodded vigorously. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere do you come from, anyway?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor, Brazil. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWas it nice there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, I see   so you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never been to Brazil?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDUDLEY! Mr DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99T BELIEVE WHAT IT\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99S DOING!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOut of the way, you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened   one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBrazil, here I come.  Thanksss, amigo.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut the glass,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he kept saying, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwhere did the glass go?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry was talking to it, weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you, Harry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo   cupboard   stay   no meals,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what time it was and he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house. When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wildlooking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look. At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gang.  The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches. Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s favorite sport: Harry Hunting. This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey stuff people\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he told Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWant to come upstairs and practice?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, thanks,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe poor toilet\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s never had anything as horrible as your head down it   it might be sick.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d said. One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs Figg\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. Mrs Figg wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t as bad as usual. It turned out she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had it for several years. That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life. As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.  There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s this?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour new school uniform,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. Harry looked in the bowl again. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t realize it had to be so wet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be stupid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d snapped Aunt Petunia. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m dyeing some of Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s old things gray for you. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll look just like everyone else\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s when I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve finished.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High   like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably. Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table. They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGet the mail, Dudley,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMake Harry get it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGet the mail, Harry.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMake Dudley get it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPoke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and   a letter for Harry. Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives   he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t belong to the library, so he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: Mr H. Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey  The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp. Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHurry up, boy!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are you doing, checking for letter bombs?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He chuckled at his own joke. Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope. Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMarge\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ill,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he informed Aunt Petunia. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAte a funny whelk. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDad!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dudley suddenly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDad, Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got something!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mine!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, trying to snatch it back. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be writing to you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cP-P-Petunia!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he gasped. Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVernon! Oh my goodness   Vernon!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI want to read that letter,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said loudly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI want to read it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry furiously, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cas it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGet out, both of you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope. Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t move. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI WANT MY LETTER!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he shouted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet me see it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d demanded Dudley. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOUT!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVernon,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9clook at the address   how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re watching the house?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWatching   spying   might be following us,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d muttered Uncle Vernon wildly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry could see Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said finally. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll ignore it. If they don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get an answer  Yes, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s best we won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do anything \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t we swear when we took him in we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s my letter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s writing to me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo one. It was addressed to you by mistake,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon shortly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have burned it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was not a mistake,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry angrily, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit had my cupboard on it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSILENCE!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr   yes, Harry   about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re really getting a bit big for it we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s second bedroom. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ask questions!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d snapped his uncle. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTake this stuff upstairs, now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The Dursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dog; in the corner was Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s first-ever television set, which he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never been touched. From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want him in there I need that room make him get out...\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have given anything to be up here. Today he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it. Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly. When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s another one!  Mr H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s letter clutched in his hand. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo to your cupboard   I mean, your bedroom,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he wheezed at Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDudley   go   just go.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t received his first letter. Surely that meant they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d try again? And this time he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d make sure they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t fail. He had a plan. The repaired alarm clock rang at six o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights. He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door   \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAAAAARRRGH!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry leapt into the air; he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat   something alive! Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do exactly what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI want  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cif they can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t deliver them they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll just give up.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not sure that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll work, Vernon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, these people\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not like you and me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him. On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom. Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back  doors so no one could go out. He hummed \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTiptoe Through the Tulips\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d as he worked, and jumped at small noises. On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dudley asked Harry in amazement. *** On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo post on Sundays,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cno damn letters today  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one   \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOut! OUT!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat does it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag. They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShake \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99em off shake \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99em off,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he would mutter whenever he did this. They didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling.  He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d missed five television programs he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d wanted to see, and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer. Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering.  They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Scuse me, but is one of you Mr H. Potter? Only I got about an \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99undred of these at the front desk.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address: Mr H. Potter Room 17 Railview Hotel Cokeworth Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll take them,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room. *** \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it be better just to go home, dear?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDaddy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone mad, hasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared. It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Monday,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he told his mother. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Great Humberto\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday   and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of  television   then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun   last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s old socks. Still, you weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t eleven every day. Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d bought. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFound the perfect place!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome on! Everyone out!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStorm forecast for tonight!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd this gentleman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve already got us some rations,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cso all aboard!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house. The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms. Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCould do with some of those letters now, eh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said cheerfully. He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t cheer him up at all. As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket. The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s snores were drowned by the low rolls  of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be eleven in ten minutes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now. Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be able to steal one somehow. Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea? One minute to go and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be eleven. Thirty seconds...twenty ten  nine   maybe he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him   three two one  BOOM. The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.   BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the cannon?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said stupidly. There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he shouted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI warn you   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m armed!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d There was a pause. Then   SMASH! The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor. A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair. The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make us a cup o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 tea, could yeh? It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not been an easy journey.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBudge up, yeh great lump,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the stranger. Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 here\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Harry!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the giant. Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLas\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 time I saw you, you was only a baby,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the giant. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got yer mom\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI demand that you leave at once, sir!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are breaking and entering!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the giant; he reached over  the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room. Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnyway   Harry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ca very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here   I mighta sat on it at some point, but it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll taste all right.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing. Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho are you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The giant chuckled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTrue, I haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s whole arm. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat about that tea then, eh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, rubbing his hands together. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got it, mind.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d sunk into a hot bath. The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The giant chuckled darkly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYer great puddin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 of a son don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 need fattenin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 anymore, Dursley, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 worry.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sorry, but I still don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t really know who you are.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his  hand. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCall me Hagrid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ceveryone does. An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 like I told yeh, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts   yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll know all about Hogwarts, o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 course. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr   no,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. Hagrid looked shocked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSorry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry said quickly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSorry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t gettin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even know abou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Hogwarts, fer cryin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cALL WHAT?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid thundered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow wait jus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 one second!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you mean ter tell me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he growled at the Dursleys, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat this boy   this boy!   knows nothin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 abou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99   about ANYTHING?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t bad. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know some things,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can, you know, do math and stuff.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbout our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 world.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat world?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDURSLEY!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he boomed. Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMimblewimble.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid stared wildly at Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut yeh must know about yer mom and dad,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI mean, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re famous. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re famous.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat? My   my mom and dad weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t famous, were they?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeh don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 know...yeh don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 know....\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeh don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 know what yeh are?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said finally. Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStop!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he commanded. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore  left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve kept it from him all these years?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKept what from me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry eagerly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSTOP! I FORBID YOU!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d yelled Uncle Vernon in panic. Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry   yer a wizard.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m a what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d gasped Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA wizard, o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 course,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 a thumpin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 good  un, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d say, once yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I reckon it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s abou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 time yeh read yer letter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards) Dear Mr Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31. Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress Questions exploded inside Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head like fireworks and he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat does it mean, they await my owl?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGallopin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Gorgons, that reminds me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another  pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl   a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl   a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry his letter. Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. Weather\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s horrible. Hope you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re well. Hagrid Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone. Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere was I?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not going,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. Hagrid grunted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, interested. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA Muggle,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s your bad luck you grew up in a family o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe swore when we took him in we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d put a stop to that rubbish,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cswore we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou knew?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou knew I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m a   a wizard?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKnew!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKnew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that   that school   and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was   a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be just the same, just as strange, just as   as   abnormal   and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBlown up? You told me they died in a car crash!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCAR CRASH!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow could a car crash kill Lily an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 James Potter? It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut why? What happened?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked urgently. The anger faded from Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face. He looked suddenly anxious. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI never expected this,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, in a low, worried voice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 hold of yeh, how much yeh didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know. Ah, Harry, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 know if I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m the right person ter tell yeh   but someone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gotta   yeh can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh   mind, I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell yeh everythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a great myst\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ry, parts of it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt begins, I suppose, with   with a person called   but it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s incredible yeh don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know his name, everyone in our world knows  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell   I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 like sayin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the name if I can help it. No one does.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy not?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGulpin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went ...bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was...\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCould you write it down?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry suggested. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNah   can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t spell it. All right   Voldemort. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid shuddered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 make me say it again. Anyway, this   this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fer followers. Got  em, too   some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 his power,  cause he was gettin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know who ter trust, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches terrible things happened. He was takin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 over.  Course, some stood up to him   an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he killed  em. Horribly. One o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t dare try takin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the school, not jus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 then, anyway. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, yer mum an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dad were as good a witch an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ry is why YouKnow-Who never tried to get  em on his side before probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ter do with the Dark Side.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMaybe he thought he could persuade  em...maybe he just wanted  em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99   an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSorry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that sad   knew yer mum an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dad, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 nicer people yeh couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t find   anyway . \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou-Know-Who killed  em. An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 then   an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 this is the real myst\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ry of the thing   he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 by then. But he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh   took care of yer mum an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dad an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 yer house, even   but it didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t work on you, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99em, no one except you, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d killed some o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the best witches an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 wizards of the age   the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts   an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you was only a baby, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you lived.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Something very painful was going on in Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mind. As Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before   and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh. Hagrid was watching him sadly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTook yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot .\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLoad of old tosh,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, you listen here, boy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he snarled, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI accept there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have cured   and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdoes, no denying it, and the world\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s better off without them in my opinion   asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types   just what I expected, always knew they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d come to a sticky end  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m warning you, Dursley   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m warning you   one more word .\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s better,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor. Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what happened to Vol-, sorry   I mean, You-Know-Who?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the biggest myst\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ry, see he was gettin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 more an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 more powerful   why\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d he go? \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSome say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s still out there, bidin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 his time, like, but I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of  em came outta kinda trances. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 reckon they could\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve done if he was comin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 back. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMost of us reckon he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Cause somethin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 goin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 on that night he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t counted on   I dunno what it was, no one does   but somethin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 about you stumped him, all right.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t they been turned into warty toads every time they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football? \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said quietly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think you must have made a mistake. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think I can be a wizard.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry chased by Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d managed to make it grow back...and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he set a boa constrictor on him? Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry Potter, not a wizard   you wait, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be  right famous at Hogwarts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d But Uncle Vernon wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to give in without a fight. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHaven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t I told you he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not going?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he hissed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to Stonewall High and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be grateful for it. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish   spell books and wands and  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop him,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d growled Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStop Lily an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 James Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s son goin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s been down ever since he was born. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know himself. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d yelled Uncle Vernon. But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNEVER  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he thundered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c  INSULT   ALBUS   DUMBLEDORE   IN   FRONT   OF   ME!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley   there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s tail poking through a hole in his trousers. Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them. Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ta lost me temper,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said ruefully, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut it didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t much left ter do.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBe grateful if yeh didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m   er   not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 get yer letters to yeh an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 stuff   one o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you supposed to do magic?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, well   I was at Hogwarts meself but I   er   got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy were you expelled?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gettin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 late and we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got lots ter do tomorrow,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid loudly.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGotta get up ter town, get all yer books an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 that.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can kip under that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 doormice in one o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the pockets.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  Harry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was a dream, he told himself firmly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be at home in my cupboard.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d There was suddenly a loud tapping noise. And there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream. Tap. Tap. Tap. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry mumbled, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m getting up.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He sat up and Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak. Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coat. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do that.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry loudly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s an owl  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPay him,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid grunted into the sofa. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe wants payin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fer deliverin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the paper. Look in the pockets.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets   bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags...finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGive him five Knuts,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid sleepily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKnuts?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe little bronze ones.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so  Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window. Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBest be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 buy all yer stuff fer school.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUm   Hagrid?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMm?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got any money   and you heard Uncle Vernon last night he won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t pay for me to go and learn magic.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t worry about that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cD\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99yeh think yer parents didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t leave yeh anything?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut if their house was destroyed  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 bank. Have a sausage, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not bad cold   an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 say no teh a bit o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 yer birthday cake, neither.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWizards have banks?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGoblins?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah   so yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be mad ter try an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 rob it, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe    cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid drew himself up proudly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you   gettin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 things from Gringotts   knows he can trust me, see.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGot everythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99? Come on, then.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow did you get here?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked, looking around for another boat. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFlew,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFlew?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah   but we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll go back in this. Not s\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99pposed ter use magic now I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got yeh.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSeems a shame ter row, though,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf I was ter   er   speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 it at Hogwarts?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf course not,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSpells   enchantments,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey say there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dragons guardin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the high security vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way   Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d die of hunger tryin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never had so many questions in his life. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMinistry o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Magic messin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 things up as usual,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid muttered, turning the page. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a Ministry of Magic?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked, before he could stop himself. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Course,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 course, but he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fer advice.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what does a Ministry of Magic do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s still witches an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 wizards up an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 down the country.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy? Blimey, Harry, everyone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be wantin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re best left alone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street. Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cdid you say there are dragons at Gringotts?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, so they say,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCrikey, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like a dragon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like one?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWanted one ever since I was a kid   here we go.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 time. Hagrid, who didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t understand \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMuggle money,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets. People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStill got yer letter, Harry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked as he counted stitches. Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a list there of everything yeh need.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t noticed the night before, and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL o f WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY UNIFORM First-year students will require: 1. Three sets of plain work robes (black) 2. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear 3. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar) 4. One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings) Please note that all pupils\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 clothes should carry name tags COURSE BOOKS All students should have a copy of each of the following: The Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling A Beginners\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Guide to Transfiguration by Emeric Switch One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore Magical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection by Quentin Trimble OTHER EQUIPMENT 1 wand 1 cauldron (pewter, standard size 2) 1 set of glass or crystal phials 1 telescope set 1 brass scales  Students may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad PARENTS ARE REMINDED THAT FIRST YEARS ARE NOT ALLOWED THEIR OWN BROOMSTICKS \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan we buy all this in London?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry wondered aloud. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf yeh know where to go,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know how the Muggles manage without magic,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops. Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help trusting him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe Leaky Cauldron. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a famous place.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t pointed it out, Harry wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside. For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe usual, Hagrid?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, Tom, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m on Hogwarts business,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, clapping his great  hand on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shoulder and making Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s knees buckle. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood Lord,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the bartender, peering at Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cis this   can this be  ?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBless my soul,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d whispered the old bartender, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry Potter what an honor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWelcome back, Mr Potter, welcome back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming. Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDoris Crockford, Mr Potter, can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m meeting you at last.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo proud, Mr Potter, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m just so proud.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAlways wanted to shake your hand   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m all of a flutter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDelighted, Mr Potter, just can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell you, Diggle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the name, Dedalus Diggle.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve seen you before!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s top hat fell off in his excitement. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou bowed to me once in a shop.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe remembers!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid you hear that? He remembers me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry shook hands again and again   Doris Crockford kept coming back for more. A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProfessor Quirrell!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cP-P-Potter,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cccan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cD-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d rather not think about it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cN-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He laughed nervously. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He looked terrified at the very thought. But the others wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMust get on   lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Doris Crockford shook Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds. Hagrid grinned at Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTold yeh, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ter meet yeh   mind you, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s usually tremblin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs he always that nervous?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience....They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 trouble with a hag   never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject   now, where\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s me umbrella?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Vampires? Hags? Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThree up two across \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he muttered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRight, stand back, Harry.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella. The brick he had touched quivered   it wriggled   in the middle, a small hole appeared   it grew wider and wider   a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWelcome,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cto Diagon Alley.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He grinned at Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall. The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons   All Sizes   Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver   Self-Stirring   Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be needin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 one,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut we gotta get yer money first.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re mad. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium   Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry heard one of them say, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe new Nimbus Two Thousand    fastest ever  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGringotts,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was   \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a goblin,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: Enter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn. So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLike I said, Yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be mad ter try an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 rob it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMorning,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid to a free goblin. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve come ter take some money outta Mr Harry Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s safe.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have his key, sir?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGot it here somewhere,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGot it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key. The goblin looked at it closely. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat seems to be in order.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The goblin read the letter carefully. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell yeh that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid mysteriously. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s trusted me. More\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99n my job\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s worth ter tell yeh that.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in   Hagrid with some difficulty   and were off. At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t steering. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late   they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI never know,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStalagmite\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got an  m\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 in it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ask me questions just now, I think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m gonna be sick.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling. Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll yours,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d smiled Hagrid. All Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s   it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have known  about this or they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London. Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe gold ones are Galleons,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he explained. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSeventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 terms, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll keep the rest safe for yeh.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He turned to Griphook. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne speed only,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Griphook. They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck. Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStand back,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Griphook. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow often do you check to see if anyone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s inside?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbout once every ten years,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Griphook with a rather nasty grin. Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least   but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome on, back in this infernal cart, and don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t talk to me on the way back, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s best if I keep me mouth shut,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had in his whole life   more money than even Dudley had ever had. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMight as well get yer uniform,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Robes for All Occasions. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cListen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He did  still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shop alone, feeling nervous. Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHogwarts, dear?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said, when Harry started to speak. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGot the lot here   another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHello,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the boy, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHogwarts, too?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s next door buying my books and mother\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s up the street looking at wands,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see why first years can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have their own. I think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll bully father into getting me one and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll smuggle it in somehow.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you got your own broom?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the boy went on. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPlay Quidditch at all?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do   Father says it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a crime if I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be in yet?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been   imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d leave, wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMmm,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI say, look at that man!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t come in. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Hagrid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe works at Hogwarts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the boy, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve heard of him. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a sort of servant, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the gamekeeper,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, exactly. I heard he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a sort of savage   lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up  setting fire to his bed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s brilliant,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry coldly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the boy, with a slight sneer. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy is he with you? Where are your parents?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re dead,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry shortly. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel much like going into the matter with this boy. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, sorry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the other, not sounding sorry at all. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut they were our kind, weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t they?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey were a witch and wizard, if that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what you mean.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI really don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re just not the same, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s your surname, anyway?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s you done, my dear,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the drawling boy. Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts). \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s up?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid, what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Quidditch?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBlimey, Harry, I keep forgettin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 how little yeh know   not knowin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 about Quidditch!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make me feel worse,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c  and he said people from Muggle families shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even be allowed in  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYer not from a Muggle family. If he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d known who yeh were   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s grown up knowin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 yer name if his parents are wizardin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in  em in a long line o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Muggles   look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo what is Quidditch?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s our sport. Wizard sport. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s like   like soccer in the Muggle world   everyone follows Quidditch   played up in the air on broomsticks and there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s four balls   sorta hard ter explain the rules.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSchool houses. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 duffers, but  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI bet I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m in Hufflepuff,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry gloomily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBetter Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid darkly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVol-, sorry  You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYears an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 years ago,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. They bought Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not sayin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 anyway, yeh couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 work any of them curses yet, yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt says pewter on yer list\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s list again. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust yer wand left   A yeah, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I still haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got yeh a birthday present.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry felt himself go red. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have to  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have to. Tell yeh what, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get yer animal. Not a toad,  toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be laughed at   an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 like cats, they make me sneeze. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re dead useful, carry yer mail an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 everythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 mention it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid gruffly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 expect you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now   only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d A magic wand this was what Harry had been really looking forward to. The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood afternoon,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair. An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHello,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry awkwardly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh yes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the man. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, yes. I thought I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a question. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou have your mother\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Mr Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Mr Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s where \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Mr Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s forehead with a long, white finger. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said softly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThirteenand-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands well, if I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d known what that wand was going out into the world to do.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He shook his head and then, to Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s relief, spotted Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again. Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was, sir, yes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mr Ollivander, suddenly stern. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr   yes, they did, yes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve still got the pieces, though,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he added brightly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t use them?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mr Ollivander sharply. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, no, sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHmmm,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mr Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, now   Mr Potter. Let me see.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhich is your wand arm?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr   well, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m right-handed,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHold out your arm. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEvery Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wand.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat will do,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRight then, Mr Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMaple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry tried   but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was  snatched back by Mr Ollivander. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no   here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll find the perfect match here somewhere   I wonder, now   yes, why not   unusual combination   holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr Ollivander cried, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well how curious how very curious \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He put Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCurious curious  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSorry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s curious?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Mr Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI remember every wand I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve ever sold, Mr Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather   just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother   why, its brother gave you that scar.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry swallowed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember I think we must expect great things from you, Mr Potter .After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things   terrible, yes, but great.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry shivered. He wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sure he liked Mr Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr Ollivander bowed them from his shop. The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington  station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGot time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. Harry wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sure he could explain. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just had the best birthday of his life   and yet   he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEveryone thinks I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m special,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said at last. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr Ollivander but I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m famous and I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even remember what I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m famous for. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what happened when Vol-, sorry   I mean, the night my parents died.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you worry, Harry. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hard. Yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been singled out, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s always hard. But yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have a great time at Hogwarts   I did   still do, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99smatter of fact.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYer ticket fer Hogwarts, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFirst o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 September   King\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Cross   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll know where to find me .See yeh soon, Harry.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.  Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s last month with the Dursleys wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him   in fact, they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while. Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first. On the last day of August he thought he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr   Uncle Vernon?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr   I need to be at King\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Cross tomorrow to   to go to Hogwarts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Uncle Vernon grunted again. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWould it be all right if you gave me a lift?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFunny way to get to a wizards\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say anything. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere is this school, anyway?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he read. His aunt and uncle stared. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPlatform what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNine and three-quarters.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t talk rubbish,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere is no platform nine and three-quarters.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s on my ticket.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBarking,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9chowling mad, the lot of them. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll see. You just wait. All right, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll take you to King\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Cross. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t bother.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy are you going to London?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTaking Dudley to the hospital,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d growled Uncle Vernon. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGot to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry woke at five o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to walk into the station in his wizard\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s robes   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off. They reached King\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, there you are, boy. Platform nine   platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem to have built it yet, do they?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave a good term,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was  he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have to ask someone. He stopped a passing guard, but didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock, but the guard said there wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl. Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s stand between platforms nine and ten. At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c  packed with Muggles, of course  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s in front of him   and they had an owl. Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the platform number?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the boys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 mother. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNine and three-quarters!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was holding her hand, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMom, can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t I go \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it   but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFred, you next,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the plump woman said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not Fred, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m George,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the boy. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHonestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you tell I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m George?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSorry, George, dear.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOnly joking, I am Fred,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the boy, and off he went. His twin called  after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone   but how had he done it? Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there   and then, quite suddenly, he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t anywhere. There was nothing else for it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExcuse me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry said to the plump woman. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHello, dear,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFirst time at Hogwarts? Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s new, too.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe thing is   the thing is, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know how to  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow to get onto the platform?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said kindly, and Harry nodded. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot to worry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop and don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be scared you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll crash into it, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr   okay,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid. He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be in trouble   leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run   the barrier was coming nearer and nearer   he wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be able to stop   the cart was out of control   he was a foot away   he closed his eyes ready for the crash   It didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t come he kept on running he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Express, eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it. Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks. The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGran, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve lost my toad again.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, Neville,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he heard the old woman sigh. A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGive us a look, Lee, go on.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg. Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWant a hand?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It was one of the red-haired twins he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d followed through the barrier. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, please,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry panted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOy, Fred! C\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99mere and help!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d With the twins\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 help, Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThanks,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lightning scar. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBlimey,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the other twin. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre you  ?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the first twin. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he added to Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry Potter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d chorused the twins. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, him,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI mean, yes, I am.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s open door. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFred? George? Are you there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cComing, Mom.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train. Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRon, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got something on your nose.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMom   geroff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He wriggled free. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said one of the twins. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShut up,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Percy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said their mother. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coming now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stay long, Mother,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, are you a prefect, Percy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou should have said something, we had no idea.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the other twin. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOnce  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOr twice  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA minute  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll summer  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, shut up,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Percy the Prefect. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow come Percy gets new robes, anyway?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said one of the twins. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBecause he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a prefect,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said their mother fondly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right, dear, well, have a good term   send me an owl when you get there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, you two   this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve   you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve blown up a toilet or  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBlown up a toilet? We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never blown up a toilet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGreat idea though, thanks, Mom.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not funny. And look after Ron.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShut up,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see him looking. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry Potter!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry heard the little girl\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please....\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAsked him. Saw his scar. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really there   like lightning.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPoor dear   no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who  looks like?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Their mother suddenly became very stern. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right, keep your hair on.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d A whistle sounded. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHurry up!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, Ginny, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll send you loads of owls.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll send you a Hogwarts\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 toilet seat.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGeorge!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOnly joking, Mom.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The train began to move. Harry saw the boys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved. Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what he was going to   but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind. The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnyone sitting there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEverywhere else is full.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHey, Ron.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The twins were back. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cListen, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going down the middle of the train   Lee Jordan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got a giant tarantula down there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRight,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d mumbled Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the other twin, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cdid we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBye,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre you really Harry Potter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron blurted out. Harry nodded. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh   well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s jokes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said  Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd have you really got   you know \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He pointed at Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s forehead. Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s where You-Know-Who  ?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t remember it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron eagerly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell   I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWow,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre all your family wizards?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr   Yes, I think so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think Mom\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got a second cousin who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s an accountant, but we never talk about him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo you must know loads of magic already.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI heard you went to live with Muggles,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are they like?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHorrible   well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had three wizard brothers.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFive,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left   Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got Bill\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s old robes, Charlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s old wand, and Percy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s old rat.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHis name\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Scabbers and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t aff   I mean, I got Scabbers instead.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ears went pink. He seemed to think he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window. Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c and until Hagrid told me, I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron gasped. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou said You-Know-Who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have thought you, of all people  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI just never knew you shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. See what I mean? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got loads to learn. I bet,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI bet I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m the worst in the class.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past. Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnything off the cart, dears?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry, who hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ears went pink again and he muttered that he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor. He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry   but the woman didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts. Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHungry, are you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStarving,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty. Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe always forgets I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t like corned beef..\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSwap you for one of these,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, holding up a pasty. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo on  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want this, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all dry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe hasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got much time,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he added quickly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou know, with five of us.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo on, have a pasty,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten). \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are these?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not really frogs, are they?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut see what the card is. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m missing Agrippa.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, of course, you wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know   Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect   famous witches and wizards. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got about five hundred, but I haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo this is Dumbledore!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell me you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never heard of Dumbledore!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan I have a frog? I might get Agrippa   thanks  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry turned over his card and read: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS C onsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling. Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face had disappeared. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t expect him to hang around all day,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be back. No, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got Morgana again and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got about six of her do you want it? You can start collecting.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHelp yourself,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut in, you know, the Muggle world,  people just stay put in photos.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo they? What, they don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t move at all?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron sounded amazed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWeird!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the Druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Every Flavor Beans. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou want to be careful with those,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron warned Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen they say every flavor, they mean every flavor   you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBleaaargh   see? Sprouts.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t touch, which turned out to be pepper. The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills. There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked tearful. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSorry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut have you seen a toad at all?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d When they shook their heads, he wailed, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve lost him! He keeps getting away from me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll turn up,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the boy miserably. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, if you see him \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He left. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know why he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s so bothered,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d brought a toad I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t talk.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The rat was still snoozing on Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lap. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe might have died and you wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know the difference,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron in disgust. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t work. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll show you, look \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking  wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUnicorn hair\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nearly poking out. Anyway  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHas anyone seen a toad? Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lost one,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve already told him we haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seen it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, but the girl wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, are you doing magic? Let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s see it, then.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She sat down. Ron looked taken aback. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr   all right.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He cleared his throat. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre you sure that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a real spell?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the girl. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not very good, is it? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all worked for me. Nobody in my family\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve heard   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She said all this very fast. Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t learned all the course books by heart either. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m Ron Weasley,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron muttered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry Potter,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre you really?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know all about you, of course   I got a few extra books, for background reading, and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAm I?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, feeling dazed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGoodness, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you know, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have found out everything I could if it was me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo either of you know what house you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be in? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been asking around, and I hope I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I  hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be too bad....Anyway, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better go and look for Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be there soon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And she left, taking the toadless boy with her. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhatever house I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m in, I hope she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not in it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStupid spell   George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat house are your brothers in?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGryffindor,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMom and Dad were in it, too. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll say if I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou know, I think the ends of Scabbers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 whiskers are a bit lighter,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, trying to take Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mind off houses. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo what do your oldest brothers do now that they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve left, anyway?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d finished school. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCharlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid you hear about Gringotts? It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t suppose you get that with the Muggles   someone tried to rob a high security vault.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry stared. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cReally? What happened to them?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s such big news. They haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been caught. My dad says it must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think they took anything, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s odd. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s behind it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVoldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d without worrying. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s your Quidditch team?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron asked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr   I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know any.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry confessed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron looked dumbfounded. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, you wait, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the best game in the world  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger  this time. Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d shown back in Diagon Alley. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs it true?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re saying all down the train that Harry Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s in this compartment. So it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s you, is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd my name\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThink my name\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He turned back to Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He held out his hand to shake Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, but Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t take it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said coolly. Draco Malfoy didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be careful if I were you, Potter,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said slowly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUnless you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re a bit politer you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll go the same way as your parents. They didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll rub off on you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Both Harry and Ron stood up. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSay that again,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron said, his face as red as his hair. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to fight us, are you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Malfoy sneered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUnless you get out now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut we don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron   Ron leapt forward, but before he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell. Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s knuckle   Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit  the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat has been going on?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s been knocked out,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo   I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe it   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone back to sleep.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And so he had. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve met Malfoy before?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve heard of his family,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron darkly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been bewitched. My dad doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe it. He says Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s father didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He turned to Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan we help you with something?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better hurry up and put your robes on, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re nearly there. You haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been fighting, have you? You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be in trouble before we even get there!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cScabbers has been fighting, not us,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, scowling at her. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWould you mind leaving while we change?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right   I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione in a sniffy voice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down. He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them. A voice echoed through the train: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor. The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFirs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 years! Firs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 years over here! All right there, Harry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cC\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99mon, follow me   any more firs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 years? Mind yer step, now! Firs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 years follow me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get yer firs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 sight o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Hogwarts in a sec,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid called over his shoulder, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cjus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 round this bend here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d There was a loud \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOooooh!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo more\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99n four to a boat!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEveryone in?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRight then   FORWARD!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHeads down!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOy, you there! Is this your toad?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTrevor!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle. They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEveryone here? You there, still got yer toad?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.  The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s first thought was that this was not someone to cross. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe firs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 years, Professor McGonagall,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors. They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right   the rest of the school must already be here   but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWelcome to Hogwarts,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten  his hair. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall return when we are ready for you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPlease wait quietly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She left the chamber. Harry swallowed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow exactly do they sort us into houses?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSome sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know any magic yet  what on earth would he have to do? He hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d learned and wondering which one she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never been more nervous, never, not even when he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d somehow turned his teacher\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom. Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air   several people behind him screamed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat the  ?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cForgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy dear Friar, haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not really even a ghost   I say, what are you all doing here?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years. Nobody answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNew students!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbout to be Sorted, I suppose?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d A few people nodded mutely. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHope to see you in Hufflepuff!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the Friar. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy old house, you know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMove along now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said a sharp voice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Sorting Ceremony\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s about to start.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, form a line,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Professor McGonagall told the first years, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand follow me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall. Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIts bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t simply open on to the heavens. Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have let it in the house. Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing   noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth   and the hat began to sing: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, you may not think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m pretty, But don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t judge on what you see, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me. You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothing hidden in your head  The Sorting Hat can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be. You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends. So put me on! Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be afraid! And don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get in a flap! You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re in safe hands (though I have none) For I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m a Thinking Cap!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve just got to try on the hat!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron whispered to Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him. Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbbott, Hannah!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause    \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHUFFLEPUFF!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shouted the hat. The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBones, Susan!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHUFFLEPUFF!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBoot, Terry!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRAVENCLAW!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBrocklehurst, Mandy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d went to Ravenclaw too, but \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBrown, Lavender\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s twin brothers catcalling. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBulstrode, Millicent\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s imagination, after all he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFinch-Fletchley, Justin!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHUFFLEPUFF!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFinnigan, Seamus,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGranger, Hermione!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Her mione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGRYFFINDOR!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shouted the hat. Ron groaned. A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re very nervous. What if he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better get back on the train? When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGRYFFINDOR,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMacDougal, Morag.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSLYTHERIN!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself. There weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t many people left now. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMoon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d , \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d , \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cParkinson\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d , then a pair of twin girls, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPatil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPatil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d , then \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPerks, Sally-Anne\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d , and then, at last   \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPotter, Harry!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPotter, did she say?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Harry Potter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHmm,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said a small voice in his ear. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDifficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s talent, A my goodness, yes   and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s interesting .So where shall I put you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot Slytherin, eh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the small voice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre you sure? You could be great, you know, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that   no? Well, if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re sure   better be GRYFFINDOR!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe got Potter! We got Potter!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water. He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell,  too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban. And now there were only three people left to be sorted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThomas, Dean,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTurpin, Lisa,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGRYFFINDOR!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell done, Ron, excellent,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cZabini, Blaise,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away. Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago. Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWelcome,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWelcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank you!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know whether to laugh or not. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs he   a bit mad?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked Percy uncertainly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMad?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Percy airily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs. The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat does look good,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you  ?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t eaten for nearly five hundred years,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the ghost. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t  need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know who you are!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron suddenly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy brothers told me about you   you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re Nearly Headless Nick!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going at all the way he wanted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLike this,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo   new Gryffindors! I hope you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s becoming almost unbearable   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the Slytherin ghost.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look too pleased with the seating arrangements. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow did he get covered in blood?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Seamus with great interest. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never asked,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Nearly Headless Nick delicately. When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding  As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m half-and-half,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Seamus. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMe dad\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a Muggle. Mom didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell him she was a witch \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The others laughed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat about you, Neville?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, my gran brought me up and she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a witch,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Neville, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me   he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned   but nothing happened until I  was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced   all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here   they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d On Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do hope they start right away, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s so much to learn, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s supposed to be very difficult  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d; \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing   \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d). Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin. It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s turban straight into Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes   and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s forehead. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOuch!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry clapped a hand to his head. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Percy. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cN-nothing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s look   a feeling that he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t like Harry at all. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked Percy. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s looking so nervous, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to   everyone knows he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s after Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look at him again. At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAhem   just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFirst years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have also been asked by Mr Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not serious?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he muttered to Percy. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMust be,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not allowed to go somewhere   the forest\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 smiles had become rather fixed. Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEveryone pick their favorite tune,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand off we go!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And the school bellowed: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach us something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, Our heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, So teach us things worth knowing, Bring back what we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve forgot, just do your best, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll do the rest, And learn until our brains all rot.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, music,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, wiping his eyes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA magic beyond all we do here!  And now, bedtime. Off you trot!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt. A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPeeves,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Percy whispered to the first years. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA poltergeist.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He raised his voice, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPeeves   show yourself.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOooooooh!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, with an evil cackle. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIckle Firsties! What fun!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo away, Peeves, or the Baron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll hear about this, I mean it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d barked Percy. Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou want to watch out for Peeves,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Percy, as they set off again. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Bloody Baron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the only one who can control him, he won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPassword?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCaput Draconis,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it   Neville needed a leg up   and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs. Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase   they were obviously in one of the towers   they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGreat food, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGet off, Scabbers! He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s chewing my sheets.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry was going to ask Ron if he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once. Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully   and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it   then Malfoy turned into the hooknosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold   there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking. He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t remember the dream at all.   There, look.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNext to the tall kid with the red hair.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWearing the glasses?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid you see his face?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid you see his scar?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes. There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk. The ghosts didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGOT YOUR CONK!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were  rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing. Filch owned a cat called Mrs Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d whisk off for Filch, who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs Norris a good kick. And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words. They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for. Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTransfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.  The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went. Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have much of a head start. Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat have we got today?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDouble Potions with the Slytherins,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them   we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be able to see if it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s true.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWish McGonagall favored us,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before. Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps. Hedwig hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl: Dear Harry, I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with  Hedwig. Hagrid Harry borrowed Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again. It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far. At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been wrong. Snape didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t dislike Harry   he hated him. Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls. Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, Yes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said softly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry Potter. Our new   celebrity.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, but they had none of Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word   like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAs there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses. I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death   if you aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a dunderhead. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPotter!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Snape suddenly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand had shot into the air. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know, sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lips curled into a sneer.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTut, tut   fame clearly isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t everything.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He ignored Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThought you wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi? Snape was still ignoring Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s quivering hand. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry quietly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think Hermione does, though, why don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you try her?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSit down,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he snapped at Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFor your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you all copying that down?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Things didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class  was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIdiot boy!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTake him up to the hospital wing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou   Potter   why didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s another point you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve lost for Gryffindor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t push it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he muttered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week   why did Snape hate him so much? \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCheer up,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door. When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice rang out, saying, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBack, Fang   back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHang on,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBack, Fang.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound. There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMake yerselves at home,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is Ron,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnother Weasley, eh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, glancing at Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s freckles. I spent  half me life chasin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 yer twin brothers away from the forest.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s knee and drooled all over his robes. Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat old git.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 as fer that cat, Mrs Norris, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get rid of her   Filch puts her up to it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry told Hagrid about Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut he seemed to really hate me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRubbish!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy should he?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Yet Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help thinking that Hagrid didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t quite meet his eyes when he said that. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s yer brother Charlie?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid asked Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI liked him a lot   great with animals.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet: GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown. Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s good for you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon. Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mentioned the date. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been happening while we were there!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t meet Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves  were looking for? As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to tell Harry?   Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday   and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTypical,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry darkly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know that you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll make a fool of yourself,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron reasonably. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnyway, I know Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all talk.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d listen about the time he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move. Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground. Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t learn by heart out of a book   not that she hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville  was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail. Harry hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t had a single letter since Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table. A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a Remembrall!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he explained. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGran knows I forget things   this tells you if there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s something you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red   oh \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve forgotten something .\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Neville was trying to remember what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand. Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going on?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMalfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got my Remembrall, Professor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust looking,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him. At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance. The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left. Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, what are you all waiting for?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she barked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEveryone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck  out at odd angles. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStick out your right hand over your broom,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d called Madam Hooch at the front, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand say  Up!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUP\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d everyone shouted. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground. Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been doing it wrong for years. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Madam Hooch. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKeep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle   three   two  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lips. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome back, boy!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle   twelve feet   twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and   WHAM   a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight. Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBroken wrist,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry heard her mutter. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome on, boy   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all right, up you get.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She turned to the rest of the class. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNone of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say  Quidditch.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Come on, dear.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him. No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid you see his face, the great lump?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The other Slytherins joined in. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShut up, Malfoy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d snapped Parvati Patil.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOoh, sticking up for Longbottom?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever thought you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that stupid thing Longbottom\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gran sent him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGive that here, Malfoy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch. Malfoy smiled nastily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find   how about   up a tree?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGive it here!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome and get it, Potter!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry grabbed his broom. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shouted Hermione Granger. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMadam Hooch told us not to move   you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get us all into trouble.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him   and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d found something he could do without being taught   this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron. He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGive it here,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry called, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cor I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll knock you off that broom!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, yeah?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried. Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry called. The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCatch it if you can, then!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground. Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down   next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball   wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching   he stretched out his  hand   a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHARRY POTTER!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d His heart sank faster than he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever   in all my time at Hogwarts  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c  how dare you   might have broken your neck  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t his fault, Professor  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBe quiet, Miss Patil  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut Malfoy  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s enough, Mr Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d done it. He hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even lasted two weeks. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep? Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s bag. Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExcuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him? But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s class looking confused. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFollow me, you two,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty  except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOut, Peeves!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPotter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve found you a Seeker.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Wood\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s expression changed from puzzlement to delight. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre you serious, Professor?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbsolutely,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall crisply. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe boy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a natural. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry nodded silently. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have a clue what was going on, but he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Professor McGonagall told Wood. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDidn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have done it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEver seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked excitedly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWood\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s captain of the Gryffindor team,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Professor McGonagall explained. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just the build for a Seeker, too,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLight  speedy   we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor   a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d say.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t bend the firstyear rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI want to hear you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Then she suddenly smiled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour father would have been proud,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe was an excellent Quidditch player himself.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re joking.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d forgotten all about it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSeeker?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut first years never   you must be the youngest house player in about  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c   a century,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWood told me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI start training next week,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOnly don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell done,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said George in a low voice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWood told us. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re on the team too   Beaters.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI tell you, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Fred. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t won since Charlie left, but this year\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnyway, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s found a new secret passageway out of the school.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBet it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHaving a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re a lot braver now that you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re back on the ground and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got your little friends with you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d take you on anytime on my own,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Malfoy. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTonight, if you want. Wizard\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s duel. Wands only   no contact. What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the matter? Never heard of a wizard\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s duel before, I suppose?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf course he has,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, wheeling around. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m his second, who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s yours?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCrabbe,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMidnight all right? We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll meet you in the trophy room; that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s always unlocked.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat is a wizard\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s duel?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what do you mean, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re my second?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, a second\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s there to take over if you die,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face, he added quickly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you  knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThrow it away and punch him on the nose,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron suggested. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cExcuse me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a person eat in peace in this place?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBet you could,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron muttered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c  and you mustn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll lose Gryffindor if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re caught, and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re bound to be. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really very selfish of you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really none of your business,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood-bye,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. All the same, it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t what you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf he tries to curse you, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better dodge it, because I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t remember how to block them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness   this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t miss it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHalf-past eleven,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron muttered at last, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better go.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to do this, Harry.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron furiously. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo back to bed!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI almost told your brother,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione snapped, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPercy   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a prefect, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d put a stop to this.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe anyone could be so interfering. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome on,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady  and climbed through the hole. Hermione wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo away.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re on the train home tomorrow, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re so  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d But what they were, they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow what am I going to do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she asked shrilly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s your problem,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to go, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to be late.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m coming with you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are not.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cD\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99you think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got some nerve  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron loudly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShut up, both of you!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry sharply. I heard something.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It was a sort of snuffling. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMrs Norris?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d breathed Ron, squinting through the dark. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t Mrs Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThank goodness you found me! I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been out here for hours, I couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t remember the new password to get in to bed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKeep your voice down, Neville. The password\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s  Pig snout\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 but it won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help you now, the Fat Lady\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone off somewhere.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s your arm?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFine,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Neville, showing them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMadam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood   well, look, Neville, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to be somewhere, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll see you later  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t leave me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Neville, scrambling to his feet, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to  stay here alone, the Bloody Baron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s been past twice already.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf either of you get us caught, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll never rest until I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward. They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room. Malfoy and Crabbe weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s late, maybe he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s chickened out,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron whispered. Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak   and it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t Malfoy. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It was Filch speaking to Mrs Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice. Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re in here somewhere,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d they heard him mutter, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cprobably hiding.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis way!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor. The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRUN!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following   they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going   they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve lost him,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering. I   told   you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI   told   you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cquickly as possible.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMalfoy tricked you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione said to Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou realize that, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you? He was never going to meet you   Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to tell her that. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s go.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to be that simple. They hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them. It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShut up, Peeves   please   you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get us thrown out.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Peeves cackled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get caughty.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot if you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t give us away, Peeves, please.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShould tell Filch, I should,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s for your own good, you know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGet out of the way,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSTUDENTS OUT OF BED!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Peeves bellowed, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSTUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door   and it was locked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re done for! This is the end!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shouts. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, move over,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAlohomora!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The lock clicked and the door swung open   they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhich way did they go, Peeves?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Filch was saying. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuick, tell me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSay  please.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say nothing if you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say please,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right   please.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say nothing if you didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe thinks this door is locked,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry whispered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be okay   get off, Neville!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s bathrobe for the last minute. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry turned around   and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d walked into a nightmare   this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far. They weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden. They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs. It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant. Harry groped for the doorknob   between Filch and death, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d take Filch. They fell backward   Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared   all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere on earth have you all been?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever mind that   pig snout, pig snout,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs. It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never speak again. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do they think they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in  a school?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron finally. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf any dog needs exercise, that one does.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t use your eyes, any of you, do you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she snapped. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDidn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you see what it was standing on. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe floor?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry suggested. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s obviously guarding something.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She stood up, glaring at them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI hope you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed   or worse, expelled. Now, if you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mind, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to bed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron stared after her, his mouth open. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, we don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mind,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d think we dragged her along, wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you. But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide   except perhaps Hogwarts. It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.  Malfoy couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s either really valuable or really dangerous,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOr both,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues. Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again. Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later. As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel. Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said: DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE. It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want everybody knowing you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got a broomstick or they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock for your first training session.  Professor McGonagall Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA Nimbus Two Thousand!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron moaned enviously. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never even touched one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a broomstick,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t allowed them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t resist it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not any old broomstick,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron grinned at Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cComets look flashy, but they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not in the same league as the Nimbus.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t afford half the handle,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Malfoy snapped back. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s elbow. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot arguing, I hope, boys?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he squeaked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPotter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s been sent a broomstick, Professor,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Malfoy quickly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, yes, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProfessor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA Nimbus Two Thousand, it is,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really thanks to Malfoy here that I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he added. Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s obvious rage and confusion. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s true,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stolen Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Remembrall I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be on the team.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo I suppose you think that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a reward for breaking rules?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI thought you weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speaking to us?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s doing us so much good.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione marched away with her nose in the air. Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWow,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s bedspread. Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top. As seven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high. Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling   he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHey, Potter, come down!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery nice,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood, his eyes glinting. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see what McGonagall meant you really are a natural. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be joining team practice three times a week.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRight,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThree Chasers,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis ball\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s called the Quaffle,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry recited. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo   that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six  hoops, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s basketball?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood curiously. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever mind,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry quickly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s another player on each side who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s called the Keeper   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThree Chasers, one Keeper,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He pointed at the three balls left inside the box. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll show you now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTake this.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to show you what the Bludgers do,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Wood said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThese two are the Bludgers.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStand back,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers. At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air   it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why you have two Beaters on each team   the Weasley twins are ours   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So   think you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got all that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThree Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry reeled off. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery good,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEr   have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever at Hogwarts. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s you. And you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c  unless they crack my head open.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers   I mean, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cis the Golden Snitch, and it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the most important ball of the lot. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s very hard to catch because it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s so fast and difficult to see. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the Seeker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s job to catch it. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages   I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s it any questions?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t practice with the Snitch yet,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s too dark, we might lose it. Let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s try you out with a few of these.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch. Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t carry on. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat Quidditch Cup\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have our name on it this year,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t gone off chasing dragons.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics. On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d seen him make Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because  Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t spoken to either of them since the day Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s broomstick had arrived. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t forget that nice wrist movement we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been practicing!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSwish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too   never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said  s\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 instead of  f\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it   Harry had to put it out with his hat. Ron, at the next table, wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t having much more luck. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWingardium Leviosa!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re saying it wrong,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry heard Hermione snap. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Wing-gardium Levi-o-sa, make the  gar\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 nice and long.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou do it, then, if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re so clever,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron snarled. Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWingardium Leviosa!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, well done!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEveryone see here, Miss Granger\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s done it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no wonder no one can stand her,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cshe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a nightmare, honestly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face   and was startled to see that she was in tears. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think she heard you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve noticed she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got no friends.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t turn up for the next class and wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween  decorations put Hermione out of their minds. A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet. Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTroll   in the dungeons   thought you ought to know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He then sank to the floor in a dead faint. There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wand to bring silence. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPrefects,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he rumbled, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9clead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Percy was in his element. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFollow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m a prefect!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow could a troll get in?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked as they climbed the stairs. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ask me, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re supposed to be really stupid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMaybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arm. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve just thought   Hermione.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat about her?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know about the troll.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron bit his lip. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, all right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he snapped. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut Percy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better not see us.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPercy!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin. Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s he doing?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry whispered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSearch me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s  fading footsteps. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heading for the third floor,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry said, but Ron held up his hand. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan you smell something?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean. And then they heard it   a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed   at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long. The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe keys in the lock,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry muttered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe could lock it in.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood idea,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron nervously. They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop   a high, petrified scream   and it was coming from the chamber they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just chained up. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, no,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the girls\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 bathroom!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry gasped. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHermione!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d they said together. It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside. Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cConfuse it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall. The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It  hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOy, pea-brain!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome on, run, run!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror. The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape. Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s neck from behind. The troll couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wand had still been in his hand when he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d jumped \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 it had gone straight up one of the troll\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nostrils. Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club. Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand   not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWingardium Leviosa!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The club flew suddenly out of the troll\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over   and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble. Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done. It was Hermione who spoke first. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs it   dead?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, I think it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just been knocked out.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUrgh   troll boogers.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He wiped it on the troll\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s trousers. A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll,  let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart. Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mind. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat on earth were you thinking of?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re lucky you weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t killed. Why aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you in your dormitory?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down. Then a small voice came out of the shadows. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPlease, Professor McGonagall   they were looking for me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMiss Granger!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI went looking for the troll because I   I thought I could deal with it on my own   you know, because I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve read all about them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher? \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf they hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t found me, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t new to them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell   in that case ...\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMiss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMiss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m very disappointed in you. If you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not hurt at all, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their houses.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione left. Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They hurried out of the chamber and didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite  apart from anything else. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe should have gotten more than ten points,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron grumbled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFive, you mean, once she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s taken off Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood of her to get us out of trouble like that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron admitted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMind you, we did save her.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe might not have needed saving if we hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t locked the thing in with her,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry reminded him. They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPig snout,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d they said and entered. The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThanks,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and hurried off to get plates. But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.   A s they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots. The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship. Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know which was worse   people telling him he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be brilliant or people telling him they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be running around underneath him holding a mattress. It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know how he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read. Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert. Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be allowed. Unfortunately,  something about their guilty faces caught Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eye. He limped over. He hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got there, Potter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLibrary books are not to be taken outside the school,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Snape. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGive it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just made that rule up,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWonder what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wrong with his leg?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDunno, but I hope it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really hurting him,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron bitterly. The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow will you learn?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway. Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBetter you than me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t refuse if there were other teachers listening. He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing. Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered inside \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 and a horrible scene met his eyes. Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBlasted thing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Snape was saying. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but   \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPOTTER!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI just wondered if I could have my book back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGET OUT! OUT!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid you get it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron asked as Harry joined them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the matter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d In a low whisper, Harry told them what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d seen. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou know what this means?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he finished breathlessly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s where he was going when we saw him   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s after whatever it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guarding! And I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes were wide. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo   he wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, she said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not very nice, but he wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHonestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d snapped Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m with Harry. I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t put anything past Snape. But what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s he after? What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that dog guarding?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sleep. He tried to empty his mind   he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 but the expression on Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t easy to forget. The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to eat some breakfast.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want anything.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust a bit of toast,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d wheedled Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not hungry.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry felt terrible. In an hour\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s time he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be walking onto the field. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry, you need your strength,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Seamus Finnigan. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSeekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThanks, Seamus,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages. By eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes. Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different  colors. Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green). Wood cleared his throat for silence. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOkay, men,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd women,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Chaser Angelina Johnson. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd women,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Wood agreed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe big one,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Fred Weasley. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe one we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve all been waiting for,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said George. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe know Oliver\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s speech by heart,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Fred told Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwe were on the team last year.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShut up, you two,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is the best team Gryffindor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s had in years. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to win. I know it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He glared at them all as if to say, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOr else.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRight. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s time. Good luck, all of you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers. Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, I want a nice fair game, all of you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMount your brooms, please.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand. Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle. Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor   what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJORDAN!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSorry, Professor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The Weasley twins\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, last year only a reserve   back to Johnson and   no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains  the Quaffle and off he goes   Flint flying like an eagle up there   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to sc  no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle   that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and   OUCH   that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger   Quaffle taken by the Slytherins   that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s blocked by a second Bludger   sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell which   nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes   she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really flying   dodges a speeding Bludger   the goal posts are ahead   come on, now, Angelina   Keeper Bletchley dives   misses   GRYFFINDORS SCORE!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBudge up there, move along.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBin watchin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 from me hut,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut it isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t the same as bein\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNope,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry hasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t had much to do yet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKept outta trouble, though, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s somethin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry. Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s game plan. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKeep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Wood had said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want you attacked before you have to be.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right there, Harry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSlytherin in possession,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Lee Jordan was saying, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cChaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the   wait a moment   was that the Snitch?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle,  too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear. Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch   all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch. Harry was faster than Higgs   he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead   he put on an extra spurt of speed   WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below   Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFoul!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d screamed the Gryffindors. Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again. Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSend him off, ref! Red card!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are you talking about, Dean?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRed card!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dean furiously. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn soccer you get shown the red card and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re out of the game!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut this isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t soccer, Dean,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron reminded him. Hagrid, however, was on Dean\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s side. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo   after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJordan!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d growled Professor McGonagall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI mean, after that open and revolting foul \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJordan, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m warning you  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never felt anything like that. It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal-posts   he had half a mind  to ask Wood to call time-out   and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t turn it. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him. Lee was still commentating. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSlytherin in possession   Flint with the Quaffle   passes Spinnet   passes Bell   hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose   only joking, Professor   Slytherins score   A no \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDunno what Harry thinks he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s doing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 know better, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d say he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d lost control of his broom but he can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid something happen to it when Flint blocked him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Seamus whispered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid said, his voice shaking. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic   no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are you doing?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d moaned Ron, gray-faced. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI knew it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione gasped, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape   look.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s doing something   jinxing the broom,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat should we do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLeave it to me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him,  obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome on, Hermione,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron muttered desperately. Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s robes. It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row   Snape would never know what had happened. It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNeville, you can look!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s jacket for the last five minutes. Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick   he hit the field on all fours   coughed   and something gold fell into his hand. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got the Snitch!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference   Harry hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results   Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hut, with Ron and Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was Snape,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron was explaining, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t take his eyes off you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRubbish,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, who hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy would Snape do somethin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 like that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI found out something about him,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he told Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guarding.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid dropped the teapot. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow do you know about Fluffy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFluffy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mine   bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 year   I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry eagerly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ask me anymore,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid gruffly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s top secret, that is.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s trying to steal it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRubbish,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid again. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a Hogwarts teacher, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d do nothin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 of the sort.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo why did he just try and kill Harry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d cried Hermione. The afternoon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve read all about them! You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blinking at all, I saw him!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m tellin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 yeh, yer wrong!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid hotly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 know why Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 try an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh   yer meddlin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 in things that don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 concern yeh. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dangerous. You forget that dog, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you forget what it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guardin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s between Professor Dumbledore an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Nicolas Flamel  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAha!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cso there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid looked furious with himself.   C hristmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again. No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI do feel so sorry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cfor all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not wanted at home.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a widemouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family. It was true that Harry wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr and Mrs Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie. When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHi, Hagrid, want any help?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron asked, sticking his head through the  branches. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNah, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m all right, thanks, Ron.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWould you mind moving out of the way?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d came Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cold drawl from behind them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose   that hut of Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s must seem like a palace compared to what your family\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s used to.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWEASLEY!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron let go of the front of Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s robes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe was provoked, Professor Snape,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMalfoy was insultin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 his family.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBe that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Snape silkily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFive points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t more. Move along, all of you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get him,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s back, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cone of these days, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get him  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI hate them both,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMalfoy and Snape.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome on, cheer up, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nearly Christmas,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTell yeh what, come with me an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 see the Great Hall, looks a treat.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, Hagrid, the last tree   put it in the far corner, would you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow many days you got left until yer holidays?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid asked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust one,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd that reminds me   Harry, Ron, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yeah, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe library?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust before the holidays? Bit keen, aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t yeh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not working,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry told him brightly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEver since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been trying to find out who he is.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid looked shocked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cListen here   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve told yeh   drop it. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 to you what that dog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guardin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUnless you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like to tell us and save us the trouble?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry added. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been through hundreds of books already and we can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t find him anywhere   just give us a hint   I know I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve read his name somewhere.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sayin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 nothin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, said Hagrid flatly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust have to find out for ourselves, then,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library. They had indeed been searching books for Flamel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows. Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are you looking for, boy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better get out, then. Go on   out!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Wishing he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be able to tell them, but they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t risk Snape hearing what they were up to. Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t surprising they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.  Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou will keep looking while I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m away, won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd send me an owl if you find anything.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be safe to ask them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery safe, as they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re both dentists,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork   bread, English muffins, marshmallows   and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t work. Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family   in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted. Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t trust him at all. He wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t send me there, can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMerry Christmas,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou, too,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWill you look at this? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got some presents!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat did you expect, turnips?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it   it sounded a bit like an owl. A second, very small parcel contained a note.  We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s friendly,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWeird!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said,  What a shape! This is money?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can keep it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid and my aunt and uncle   so who sent these?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think I know who that one\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s from,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy mom. I told her you didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t expect any presents and   oh, no,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he groaned, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cshe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s made you a Weasley sweater.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEvery year she makes us a sweater,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, unwrapping his own, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand mine\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s always maroon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really nice of her,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty. His next present also contained candy   a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione. This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it. Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve heard of those,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d gotten from Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what I think it is   they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re really rare, and really valuable.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s an invisibility cloak,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, a look of awe on his face. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sure it is   try it on.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is! Look down!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a note!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron suddenly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA note fell out of it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words:  Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well. A Very Merry Christmas to you. There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d give anything for one of these,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnything. What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the matter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father? Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMerry Christmas!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHey, look   Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got a Weasley sweater, too!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s is better than ours, though,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Fred, holding up Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sweater. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe obviously makes more of an effort if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not family.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you wearing yours, Ron?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d George demanded. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome on, get it on, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re lovely and warm.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI hate maroon,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got a letter on yours,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d George observed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose she thinks you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t forget your name. But we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not stupid   we know we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re called Gred and Forge.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all this noise?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cP for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re all wearing ours, even Harry got one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI   don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t   want  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not sitting with the prefects today, either,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said George. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cChristmas is a time for family.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.  Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him. Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided. When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs Norris\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Christmas dinner. Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have lost so badly if Percy hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tried to help him so much. After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d stolen his prefect badge. It had been Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it. Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it. His father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s this had been his father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.  He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling. Use it well. Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know. Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back   his father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cloak   he felt that this time   the first time   he wanted to use it alone. He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor. Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked. The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps. The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles. They didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be. He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open. A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence   the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp,  which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside   stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shrieks still ringing in his ears. He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s been in the library Restricted Section.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Restricted Section? Well, they can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be far, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll catch them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d knock right into him   the cloak didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop him from being solid. He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in. It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way. It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it. He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He  whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed   for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him. But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror. There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder   but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not? He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 she and the others existed only in the mirror. She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes   her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green   exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s did. Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMom?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he whispered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDad?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s knobbly knees   Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life. The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. How long he stood there, he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face, whispered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll come back,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and hurried from the room. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou could have woken me up,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, crossly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can come tonight, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going back, I want to show you the mirror. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like to see your mom and dad,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron said eagerly.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can see them any old time,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you eating anything?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really? \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre you all right?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou look odd.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m freezing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s forget it and go back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry hissed. I know it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s here somewhere.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s here   just here   yes!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror. There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry whispered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see anything.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook! Look at them all there are loads of them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can only see you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas. Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook at me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan you see all your family standing around you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m alone   but I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m different   I look older   and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m head boy!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m wearing the badge like Bill used to   and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m holding the  house cup and the Quidditch cup   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m Quidditch captain, too.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you think this mirror shows the future?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow can it? All my family are dead   let me have another look  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re only holding the Quidditch cup, what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s interesting about that? I want to see my parents.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t push me  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. They hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t realized how loudly they had been talking. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuick!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing   did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t safe   she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And Ron pulled Harry out of the room. The snow still hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t melted the next morning. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWant to play chess, Harry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t we go down and visit Hagrid?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo you go \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know what you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go back tonight.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy not?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI dunno, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve just got a bad feeling about it   and anyway, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs Norris are wandering around. So what if they can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou sound like Hermione.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m serious, Harry, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to stop him. That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t meet  anyone. And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all. Except   \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo   back again, Harry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t noticed him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI   I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see you, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStrange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know it was called that, Sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I expect you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve realized by now what it does?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt   well   it shows me my family  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow did you know  ?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t need a cloak to become invisible,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore gently. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry shook his head. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry thought. Then he said slowly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt shows us what we want  whatever we want \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes and no,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore quietly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be  prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry stood up. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSir   Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cObviously, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve just done so,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dumbledore smiled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou may ask me one more thing, however.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do you see when you look in the mirror?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry stared. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne can never have enough socks,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnother Christmas has come and gone and I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.  Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams. Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf Filch had caught you!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d), and disappointment that he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was. They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again. Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training. Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWill you stop messing around!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he yelled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s exactly the sort of thing that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll lose us the match! Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s refereeing this time, and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s refereeing?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhen\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not going to be fair if we might  overtake Slytherin.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not my fault,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Wood. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got an excuse to pick on us.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch.  The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t talk to me for a moment,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI need to concen \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He caught sight of Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the matter with you? You look terrible.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t play,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione at once. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSay you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re ill,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPretend to break your leg,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione suggested. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cReally break your leg,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t play at all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower. Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat happened?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMalfoy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Neville shakily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI met him outside the library. He said he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been looking for someone to practice that on.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo to Professor McGonagall!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione urged Neville. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cReport him!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Neville shook his head. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want more trouble,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he mumbled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to stand up to him, Neville!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s used to walking all over people, but that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no need to tell me I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s already done that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Neville choked out.  Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re worth twelve of Malfoy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it? And where\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThanks, Harry I think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll go to bed. D\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99you want the card, you collect them, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDumbledore again,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe was the first one I ever  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve found him!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he whispered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve found Flamel! I told you I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here   listen to this:  Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t looked so excited since they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStay there!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI never thought to look in here!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she whispered excitedly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLight?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself. At last she found what she was looking for. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI knew it! I knew it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre we allowed to speak yet?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNicolas Flamel,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she whispered dramatically, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cis the only known maker of the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d This didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have quite the effect she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d expected. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry and Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, honestly, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you two read? Look \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 read that, there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone,  a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal. There have been many reports of the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixtyfifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight). \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe dog must be guarding Flamel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re friends and he knew someone was after it, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo wonder Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s after it! Anyone would want it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd no wonder we couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not exactly recent if he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s six hundred and sixty-five, is he?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d do with a Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone if they had one. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t until Ron said he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to play,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he told Ron and Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, all the Slytherins will think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m just too scared to face Snape. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll show them it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust as long as we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not wiping you off the field,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee? Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d found out about the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone? Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t  see how he could   yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds. Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d ever see him alive again. This wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t what you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand. Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t forget, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Locomotor Mortis,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron snapped. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t nag.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe whole school\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s out there!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEven   blimey   Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s come to watch!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heart did a somersault. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDumbledore?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard. Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching. Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never seen Snape look so mean,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he told Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook   they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re off. Ouch!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, sorry, Weasley, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see you there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWonder how long Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because  George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s people they feel sorry for. See, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Potter, who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got no parents, then there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the Weasleys, who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got no money   you should be on the team, Longbottom, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got no brains.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he stammered. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou tell him, Neville.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLongbottom, if brains were gold you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be poorer than Weasley, and that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s saying something.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m warning you, Malfoy   one more word \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRon!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione suddenly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat? Where?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re in luck, Weasley, Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s obviously spotted some money on the ground!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Malfoy. Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome on, Harry!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape   she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle. Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches   the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand. The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRon! Ron! Where are you? The game\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s over! Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s won! We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat  and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front. Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe it. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d done it   the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped   then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s smiling face. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell done,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNice to see you haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been brooding about that mirror...been keeping busy...excellent...\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Snape spat bitterly on the ground. Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ever remember feeling happier. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d really done something to be proud of now \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed. Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d done it, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d shown Snape .... And speaking of Snape  A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner   what was going on? Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed. The trees were so thick he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see where Snape had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree. He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves. Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c d-don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, I thought we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d keep this private,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Snape, his voice icy. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStudents aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t supposed to know about the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone, after all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHave you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s yet?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cB-b-but Severus, I  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Snape, taking a step toward him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI-I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what you \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou know perfectly well what I mean.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c  your little bit of hocus-pocus. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m waiting.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cB-but I d-d-don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Snape cut in. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have another little chat soon, when you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry, where have you been?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione squeaked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe won! You won! We won!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be all right   talk about showing Slytherin! I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve waiting for you in the common room, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever mind that now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry breathlessly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s find an empty room, you wait \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99til you hear this....\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He made sure Peeves wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d seen and heard. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo we were right, it is the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone, and Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy   and he said something about Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s  hocus pocus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99   I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo you mean the Stone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione in alarm.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be gone by next Tuesday,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron.  Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look as though he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d cracked yet. Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s stutter. Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHermione, the exams are ages away.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTen weeks,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione snapped. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not ages, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not six hundred years old,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron reminded her. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnyway, what are you studying for, you already know it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s an A.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gotten into me. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll never remember this,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really fine day they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had in months. The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming. Harry, who was looking up \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDittany\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look up until he heard Ron say, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid! What are you doing  in the library?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 lookin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re you lot up ter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He looked suddenly suspicious. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYer not still lookin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, we found out who he is ages ago,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron impressively. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd we know what that dog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guarding, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s St \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShhhh!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 go shoutin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 about it, what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the matter with yeh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cabout what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSHHHH!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid again. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cListen   come an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 see me later, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not promisin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll tell yeh anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, mind, but don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 go rabbitin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 about it in here, students aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99pposed ter know. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve told yeh  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee you later, then,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. Hagrid shuffled off. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat was he hiding behind his back?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione thoughtfully. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you think it had anything to do with the Stone?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to see what section he was in,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDragons!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he whispered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Guide.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s against our laws,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re keeping dragons in the back garden   anyway, you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tame dragons, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got off wild ones in Romania.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut there aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t wild dragons in Britain?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf course there are,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCommon Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve spotted them, to make them forget.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo what on earth\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Hagrid up to?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione.  When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them. It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo   yeh wanted to ask me somethin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe were wondering if you could tell us what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guarding the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone apart from Fluffy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid frowned at him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cO\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 course I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNumber one, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 tell yeh if I could. That Stone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts   I s\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ppose yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve worked that out an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 all? Beats me how yeh even know abou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Fluffy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe only wondered who had done the guarding, really.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione went on. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s see he borrowed Fluffy from me then some o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the teachers did enchantments  Professor Sprout   Professor Flitwick   Professor McGonagall  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he ticked them off on his fingers, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProfessor Quirrell   an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Dumbledore himself did somethin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 course. Hang on, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah   yer not still on abou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not about ter steal it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything   except, it seemed, Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s spell and how to get past Fluffy. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you, Hagrid?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry anxiously. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell anyone, would you? Not even one of the teachers?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot a soul knows except me an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Dumbledore,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid proudly.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s something,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry muttered to the others. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid, can we have a window open? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m boiling.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, Harry, sorry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid   what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s   er \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere did you get it, Hagrid?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve cost you a fortune.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWon it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLas\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 night. I was down in the village havin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 a few drinks an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 got into a game o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what are you going to do with it when it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hatched?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve bin doin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 some readin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGot this outta the library   Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a bit outta date, o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 course, but it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all in here. Keep the egg in the fire,  cause their mothers breathe on I em, see, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 see here   how ter recognize diff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99rent eggs   what I got there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a Norwegian Ridgeback. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re rare, them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid, you live in a wooden house,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. But Hagrid wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire. So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWonder what it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s like to have a peaceful life,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts. Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid. He had written only two words: It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hatching. Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t hear of it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got lessons, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get into trouble, and that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothing to what  Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to be in when someone finds out what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s doing \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShut up!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry whispered. Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t like the look on Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face at all. Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nearly out.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He ushered them inside. The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it. They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath. All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes. It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIsn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he beautiful?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBless him, look, he knows his mommy!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9chow fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face   he leapt to his feet and ran to the window. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the matter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSomeone was lookin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 through the gap in the curtains   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a kid   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s runnin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 back up ter the school.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no mistaking him. Malfoy had seen the dragon. Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their free time in Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s darkened hut, trying to reason with him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust let him go,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry urged. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSet him free.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s too little. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d die.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a  week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve decided to call him Norbert,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Mommy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lost his marbles,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron muttered in Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ear. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry loudly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cgive it two weeks and Norbert\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid bit his lip. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI   I know I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t keep him forever, but I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t jus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dump him, I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry suddenly turned to Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCharlie.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re losing it, too,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m Ron, remember?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo   Charlie   your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBrilliant!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow about it, Hagrid?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to ask him. The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s invisibility cloak. He had been down at Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt bit me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the most horrible animal I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d There was a tap on the dark window. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Hedwig!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, hurrying to let her in. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have Charlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s answer!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The three of them put their heads together to read the note. Dear Ron, How are you? Thanks for the letter   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be glad to take the Norwegian  Ridgeback, but it won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be seen carrying an illegal dragon. Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s still dark. Send me an answer as soon as possible. Love, Charlie They looked at one another. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got the invisibility cloak,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be too difficult \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert   and Malfoy. There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey   would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s fangs were poisonous. Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not just my hand,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he whispered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9calthough that feels like it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve told her it was a dog, but I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think she believes me   I shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s doing this.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione, but this didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMidnight on Saturday!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said in a hoarse voice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh no oh no   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve just remembered   Charlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to know we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re getting rid of Norbert.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry and Hermione didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s too late to change the plan now,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry told Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of  Norbert. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have to risk it. And we have got the invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know about that.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t let you in,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he puffed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNorbert\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s at a tricky stage   nothin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t handle.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d When they told him about Charlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAargh! It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all right, he only got my boot   jus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 playin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s only a baby, after all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t come quickly enough. They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hut because they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got lots o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 rats an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 some brandy fer the journey,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid in a muffled voice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBye-bye, Norbert!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMommy will never forget you!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. UP another staircase, then another \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 even one of Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shortcuts didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make the work much easier. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNearly there!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower. Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared. Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDetention!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she shouted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t understand, Professor. Harry Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coming   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got a dragon!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on   I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMalfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got detention! I could sing!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry advised her. Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness. Charlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much. At last, Norbert was going going gone. They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon   Malfoy in detention   what could spoil their happiness? The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, well, well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he whispered, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwe are in trouble.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower.  Things couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have been worse. Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased each other around Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the invisibility cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already. Had Harry thought that things couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI would never have believed it of any of you. Mr Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s one o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got a good idea of what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s been going on,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve already caught him. I suppose you think it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry caught Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Neville   Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m disgusted,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFour students out of bed in one night! I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions   yes, you too, Mr Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s very dangerous   and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFifty?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry gasped   they would lose the lead, the lead he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d won in the last Quidditch match. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFifty points each,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProfessor   please  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell me what I can and can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one night, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this? Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d done? At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been a mistake. How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years. From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThanks Potter, we owe you one!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Only Ron stood by him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been here, and people still like them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry miserably. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell   no,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron admitted. It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t his business from now on. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cResign?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Wood thundered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat good\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t win at Quidditch?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe Seeker.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t as well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence. Harry was almost glad that the exams weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions.... Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo   no   not again, please  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right   all right  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he heard Quirrell sob. Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d promised himself about not meddling. All the same, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have gambled twelve Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step   Quirrell seemed to have given in at last. Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on  Astronomy. Harry told them what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d heard. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s done it, then!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s still Fluffy, though,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMaybe Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI bet there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo to Dumbledore. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be thrown out for sure.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got no proof!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s too scared to back us up. Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s only got to say he doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor   who do you think they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll believe, him or us? It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help us if his life depended on it, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll think. And don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t forget, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll take a lot of explaining.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf we just do a bit of poking around  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry flatly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve done enough poking around.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons. The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same: Your detention will take place at eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock tonight. Meet Mr Filch in the entrance hall. Professor McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d got. At eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there    and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFollow me,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI bet you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you, eh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, leering at them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh yes hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me .It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just a pity they let the old punishments die out hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got the chains still in my office, keep  em well oiled in case they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re ever needed Right, off we go, and don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think of running off, now, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be worse for you if you do.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be sounding so delighted. The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hut. Then they heard a distant shout. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIs that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because Filch said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose you think you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s into the forest you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m much mistaken if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll all come out in one piece.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe forest?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he repeated, and he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sound quite as cool as usual. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go in there at night   there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all sorts of things in there   werewolves, I heard.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s robe and made a choking noise. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s your problem, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Filch, his voice cracking with glee. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShould\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 time,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI bin waitin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fer half an hour already. All right, Harry, Hermione?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Filch coldly, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re here to be punished, after all.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why yer late, is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBin lecturin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 them, eh?  Snot your place ter do that. Yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve done yer bit, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll take over from here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be back at dawn,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Filch, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cfor what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s left of them,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness. Malfoy now turned to Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not going in that forest,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid fiercely. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve done wrong an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 now yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got ter pay fer it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut this is servant stuff, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not for students to do. I thought we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c tell yer that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s how it is at Hogwarts,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid growled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCopyin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 lines! What good\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that ter anyone? Yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll do summat useful or yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get out. If yeh think yer father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 pack. Go on.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Malfoy didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRight then,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cnow, listen carefully,  cause it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dangerous what we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re gonna do tonight, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 want no one takin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 risks. Follow me over here a moment.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook there,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9csee that stuff shinin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 on the ground? Silvery stuff? That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s unicorn blood. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re gonna try an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 that lives in the forest that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 keep ter the path. Right, now, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re gonna split inter two parties an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 follow the trail in diff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99rent directions. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s blood all over the place, it must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve bin staggerin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 around since last night at least.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI want Fang,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s long teeth. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right, but I warn yeh, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a coward,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo me, Harry, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll go one way an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Draco, Neville, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Fang\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 practice now   that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s it   an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll all come an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 find yeh   so, be careful   let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s go.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in  the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right. They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves. Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCould a werewolf be killing the unicorns?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot fast enough,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou all right, Hermione?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid whispered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 worry, it can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve gone far if it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s this badly hurt, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 then we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be able ter   GET BEHIND THAT TREE!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI knew it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he murmured. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s summat in here that shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 be.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA werewolf?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry suggested. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 no werewolf an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 no unicorn, neither,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid grimly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRight, follow me, but careful, now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid called. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShow yerself   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m armed!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And into the clearing came   was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s jaws dropped. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s you, Ronan,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid in relief. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow are yeh?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He walked forward and shook the centaur\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood evening to you, Hagrid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful voice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWere you going to shoot me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be too careful, Ronan,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, patting his crossbow. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 this is Ronan, you two. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a centaur. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d noticed,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione faintly.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood evening,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ronan. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStudents, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cErm  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA bit,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione timidly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cA bit. Well, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s something.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ronan sighed. He flung back his head and stared at the sky. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMars is bright tonight.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, glancing up, too. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cListen, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m glad we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve run inter yeh, Ronan,  cause there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a unicorn bin hurt   you seen anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ronan didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAlways the innocent are the first victims,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo it has been for ages past, so it is now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut have yeh seen anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Ronan? Anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 unusual?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMars is bright tonight,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUnusually bright.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah, but I was meanin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 unusual a bit nearer home, said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo yeh haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t noticed anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 strange?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe forest hides many secrets.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHullo, Bane,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell enough. Look, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve jus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 bin askin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Ronan, you seen anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 odd in here lately? There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a unicorn bin injured   would yeh know anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 about it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMars is bright tonight,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said simply. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve heard,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid grumpily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, if either of you do see anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, let me know, won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t yeh? We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be off, then.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNever,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid irritably, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9ctry an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 get a straight answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 closer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99n the moon.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre there many of them in here?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d asked Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, a fair few .Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re good enough about turnin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 up if ever I want a word. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re deep, mind, centaurs they know things jus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 let on much.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cD\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDid that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s bin killin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the unicorns \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 never heard anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 like it before.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arm. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou two wait here!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid shouted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStay on the path, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll come back for yeh!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been hurt, do you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d whispered Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t care if Malfoy has, but if something\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got Neville it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s our fault he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s here in the first place.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others? At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be lucky ter catch anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 now, with the racket you two were makin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99. Right, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re changin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 groups   Neville, you stay with me an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 this idiot. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sorry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cbut he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have a harder time frightenin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve gotta get this done.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy. Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer. It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles  where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves. Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered. Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s side, and began to drink its blood. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAAAAAAAAAARGH!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted   so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry   unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry   he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t move for fear. Then a pain like he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure. The pain in Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAre you all right?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes   thank you   what was that?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The centaur didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s forehead. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are the Potter boy,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time   especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy name is Firenze,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back. There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFirenze!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Bane thundered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you realize who this is?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Firenze. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat have you been telling him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d growled Bane. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRemember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is  to come in the movements of the planets?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ronan pawed the ground nervously. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c he said in his gloomy voice. Bane kicked his back legs in anger. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFor the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you not see that unicorn?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Firenze bellowed at Bane. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them. Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have a clue what was going on. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Bane so angry?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he asked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat was that thing you saved me from, anyway?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, startled by the odd question. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Firenze. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOnly one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry stared at the back of Firenze\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be that desperate?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he wondered aloud. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to be cursed forever, death\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s better, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Firenze agreed, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cunless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else   something that will bring you back to full strength and power   something that will mean you can never die. Mr Potter, do you  know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone! Of course   the Elixir of Life! But I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t understand who  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSome say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you mean,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry croaked, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat was Vol-\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry! Harry, are you all right?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m fine,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe unicorn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dead, Hagrid, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s in that clearing back there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis is where I leave you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are safe now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry slid off his back. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood luck, Harry Potter,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Firenze. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him. Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest. Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape wants the stone for Voldemort and Voldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s waiting in the forest and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich .\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStop saying the name!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them. Harry wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t listening. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFirenze saved me, but he shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have done so. Bane was furious  he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen .They must show that Voldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coming back. Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me. I suppose that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s written in the stars as well.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWill you stop saying the name!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron hissed.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo all I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry went on feverishly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthen Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off ... Well, I suppose Bane\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be happy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry, everyone says Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of with Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a very imprecise branch of magic.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s surprises weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t over. When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it: Just in case.   In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door. It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anticheating spell. They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox   points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion. Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it. Maybe it was because they hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to. Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d invented selfstirring cauldrons and they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help cheering with the rest. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat was far easier than I thought it would be,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI needn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have learned  about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo more studying,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou could look more cheerful, Harry, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got a week before we find out how badly we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve done, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no need to worry yet.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry was rubbing his forehead. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI wish I knew what this means!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he burst out angrily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy scar keeps hurting   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s happened before, but never as often as this.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo to Madam Pomfrey,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione suggested. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not ill,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a warning it means danger\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coming .\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get worked up, it was too hot. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry, relax, Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s right, the Stone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s safe as long as Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s around. Anyway, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry nodded, but he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d done that one.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy never but . Harry suddenly jumped to his feet. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re you going?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron sleepily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve just thought of something,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. He had turned white. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you think it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a bit odd,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthat what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s against wizard law? Lucky they  found Hagrid, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you think? Why didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t I see it before?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are you talking about?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t answer. Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHullo,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, smiling. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFinished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, please,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, but Harry cut him off. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re in a hurry. Hagrid, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDunno,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid casually, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9che wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 take his cloak off.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 funny folk in the Hog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Head   that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMighta come up,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah he asked what I did, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I told him I was gamekeeper here He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after so I told him an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I said what I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d always really wanted was a dragon an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 then I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 remember too well,  cause he kept buyin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 me drinks Let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s see yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 we could play cards fer it if I wanted but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 want it ter go ter any old home .So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd did he   did he seem interested in Fluffy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell   yeah   how many three-headed dogs d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a piece o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 play him a bit o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 music an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll go straight off ter sleep  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid suddenly looked horrified. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ta told yeh that!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he blurted out. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cForget I said it! Hey   where\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re yeh goin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to go to Dumbledore,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak   it must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been easy, once he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore  believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop him. Where\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s office?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll just have to  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are you three doing inside?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe want to see Professor Dumbledore,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee Professor Dumbledore?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry swallowed   now what? \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sort of secret,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, but he wished at once he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, because Professor McGonagall\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nostrils flared. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProfessor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said coldly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry frantically. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProfessor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut this is important.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSomething you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProfessor   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s about the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t pick them up. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow do you know  ?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she spluttered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProfessor, I think   I know   that Sn  that someone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to try and steal the Stone. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProfessor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said finally. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s too well protected.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut Professor  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPotter, I know what I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m talking about,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the  sunshine.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d But they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s tonight,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going through the trapdoor tonight. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s found out everything he needs, and now he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut what can we  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round. Snape was standing there. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood afternoon,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said smoothly. They stared at him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be inside on a day like this,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, with an odd, twisted smile. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe were  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou want to be more careful,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Snape. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHanging around like this, people will think you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re up to something. And Gryffindor really can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t afford to lose any more points, can it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBe warned, Potter   any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He strode off in the direction of the staffroom. Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRight, here\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to do,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he whispered urgently. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOne of us has got to keep an eye on Snape   wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better do that.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s obvious,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He put on a high voice, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c Oh Professor Flitwick, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong .\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, shut up,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry told Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome on.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d But that part of the plan didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose you think you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she stormed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEnough of this nonsense! If I hear you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve come  anywhere near here again, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAt least Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s on Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s tail,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sorry, Harry!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she wailed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve only just got away, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know where Snape went.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s it then, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry said. The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going out of here tonight and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to try and get to the Stone first.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re mad!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAfter what McGonagall and Snape have said? You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be expelled!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSO WHAT\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry shouted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coming back! Haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t matter anymore, can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you see? D\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99you think he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m never going over to the Dark Side! I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He glared at them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re right Harry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione in a small voice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll use the invisibility cloak,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just lucky I got it back.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut will it cover all three of us?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll   all three of us?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, come off it, you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d let you go alone?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf course not,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione briskly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow do you think you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d get to the Stone without us? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better go and took through my books, there might be something useful .\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot if I can help it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione grimly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFlitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not throwing me out after that.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do. Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBetter get the cloak,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy   he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel much like singing. He ran back down to the common room. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat are you doing?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been making another bid for freedom. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing, Neville, nothing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back. Neville stared at their guilty faces. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going out again,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no, no,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not. Why don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you go to bed, Neville?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go out,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Neville, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cyou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t understand,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthis is important.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate. I won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t let you do it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll fight you!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNeville, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRon exploded, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cget away from that hole and don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be an idiot  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you call me an idiot!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Neville. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, but not to us,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron in exasperation. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNeville, you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re doing.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt  out of sight. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo on then, try and hit me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Neville, raising his fists. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m ready!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry turned to Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo something,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said desperately. Hermione stepped forward. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNeville,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m really, really sorry about this.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She raised her wand. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPetrificus Totalus!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she cried, pointing it at Neville. Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board. Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s jaws were jammed together so he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve you done to him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry whispered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the full Body-Bind,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione miserably. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, Neville, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m so sorry.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe had to, Neville, no time to explain,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll understand later, Neville,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak. But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs Norris skulking near the top. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s kick her, just this once,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron whispered in Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do anything. They didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s there?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKnow you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re there, even if I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShould call Filch, I should, if something\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a-creeping around unseen.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry had a sudden idea. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPeeves,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, in a hoarse whisper, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cthe Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo sorry, your bloodiness, Mr Baron, Sir,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said greasily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy mistake, my mistake   I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see you   of course I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re invisible   forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have business here, Peeves,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d croaked Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStay away from this place tonight.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI will, sir, I most certainly will,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Peeves, rising up in the air again. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHope your business goes well, Baron, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll not bother you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And he scooted off. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBrilliant, Harry!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d whispered Ron. A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor   and the door was already ajar. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, there you are,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry said quietly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s already got past Fluffy.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf you want to go back, I won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blame you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou can take the cloak, I won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t need it now.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be stupid,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re coming,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. Harry pushed the door open. As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that at its feet?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione whispered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLooks like a harp,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape must have left it there.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt must wake up the moment you stop playing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, here goes  .\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He put Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t really a tune, but from the first note the beast\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s growls ceased   it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKeep playing,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be able to pull the door open,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, peering over the dog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s back. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWant to go first, Hermione?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat can you see?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione said anxiously. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNothing   just black   there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no way of climbing down, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll just  have to drop.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou want to go first? Are you sure?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep. Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom. He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIf anything happens to me, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRight,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee you in a minute, I hope  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and   FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s okay!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cit\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a soft landing, you can jump!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s this stuff?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d were his first words. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s other side. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe must be miles under the school,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLucky this plant thing\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s here, really,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLucky!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shrieked Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook at you both!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing. Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStop moving!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione ordered them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI know what this is   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Devil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Snare!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m so glad we know what it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s called, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a great help,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cShut up, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m trying to remember how to kill it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, hurry up, I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t breathe!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDevil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Snare, Devil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Snare what did Professor Sprout say?   it likes the dark and the damp.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo light a fire!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry choked. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes   of course   but there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no wood!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione cried, wringing her hands. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHAVE YOU GONE MAD?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron bellowed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, right!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cand lucky Harry doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t lose his head in a crisis    there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no wood,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 honestly.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis way,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward. All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon   Norbert had been bad enough . \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCan you hear something?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron whispered. Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you think it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a ghost?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know sounds like wings to me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s light ahead   I can see something moving.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite  side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you think they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll attack us if we cross the room?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProbably,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once well, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no other choice I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll run.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked. The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow what?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThese birds they can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be here just for decoration,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering   glittering? \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not birds!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry said suddenly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re keys! Winged keys   look carefully. So that must mean \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c yes   look! Broomsticks! We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to catch the key to the door!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut there are hundreds of them!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron examined the lock on the door. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re looking for a big, old-fashioned one   probably silver, like the handle.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one. Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. After a minute\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat one!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he called to the others. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat big one   there   no, there   with bright blue wings   the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to close in on it!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRon, you come at it from above   Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and  Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cheers echoed around the high chamber. They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cReady?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open. The next chamber was so dark they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight. They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 the towering white chessmen had no faces. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow what do we do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry whispered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s obvious, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to play our way across the room.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Behind the white pieces they could see another door. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione nervously. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI think,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to have to be chessmen.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo we   er   have to join you to get across?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis needs thinking about \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI suppose we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces .\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not offended,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry quickly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust tell us what to do.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you next to him instead of that castle.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat about you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to be a knight,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhite always plays first in chess,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, peering across the board. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes look \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d A white pawn had moved forward two squares. Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s knees were trembling. What if they lost? \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry   move diagonally four squares to the right.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHad to let that happen,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, looking shaken. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLeaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re nearly there,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he muttered suddenly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet me think   let me think \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The white queen turned her blank face toward him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron softly, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the only way I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to be taken.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNO!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry and Hermione shouted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s chess!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d snapped Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll take me   that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDo you want to stop Snape or not?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cRon  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook, if you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t hurry up, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll already have the Stone!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d There was no alternative. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cReady?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron called, his face pale but determined. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere I go   now, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t hang around once you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve won.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor   Hermione screamed but stayed on her square   the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been knocked out. Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door  and up the next passageway. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat if he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s  ?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be all right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, trying to convince himself. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do you reckon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s next?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had Sprout\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, that was the Devil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Snare; Flitwick must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s spell, and Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They had reached another door. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAll right?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry whispered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGo on.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry pushed it open. A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m glad we didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have to fight that one,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome on, I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t breathe.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do we have to do?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it: Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, Two of us will help you, which ever you would find, One among us seven will let you move ahead, Another will transport the drinker back instead, Two among our number hold only nettle wine, Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line. Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: First, however slyly the poison tries to hide You will always find some on nettle wine\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s left side; Second, different are those who stand at either end, But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;  Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; Fourth, the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight. Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBrilliant,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t magic   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s logic   a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got an ounce of logic, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be stuck in here forever.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut so will we, won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t we?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf course not,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cEverything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut how do we know which to drink?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGive me a minute.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGot it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe smallest bottle will get us through the black fire   toward the Stone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry looked at the tiny bottle. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s only enough there for one of us,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hardly one swallow.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d They looked at each other. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhich one will get you back through the purple flames?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou drink that,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy   go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m no match for him, really.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut Harry   what if You-Know-Who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s with him?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell   I was lucky once, wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t I?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, pointing at his scar. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI might get lucky again.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHermione!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry   you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re a great wizard, you know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not as good as you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMe!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBooks! And cleverness! There are more important things   friendship and bravery and   oh Harry   be careful!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou drink first,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou are sure which is which, aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPositive,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not poison?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry anxiously. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo   but it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s like ice.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuick, go, before it wears off.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood luck   take care.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGO!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire. Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHere I come,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp. It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel them   for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire   then he was on the other side, in the last chamber. There was already someone there   but it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t Snape. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even Voldemort.   It was Quirrell. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d gasped Harry. Quirrell smiled. His face wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t twitching at all. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMe,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said calmly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI wondered whether I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be meeting you here, Potter.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I thought   Snape  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSeverus?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Quirrell laughed, and it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, Severus does seem the type, doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t take it in. This couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be true, it couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut Snape tried to kill me!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have got you off that broom. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have managed it before then if Snape hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSnape was trying to save me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOf course,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Quirrell coolly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhy do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do it again. Funny, really he needn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have bothered. I couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular and what a waste of time, when after all that, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to kill you tonight.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou let the troll in?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCertainly. I have a special gift with trolls   you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else  was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off   and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even manage to bite Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s leg off properly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThis mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTrust Dumbledore to come up with something like this but he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s in London I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be far away by the time he gets back \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI saw you and Snape in the forest  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he blurted out. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me   as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side .\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see the Stone I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m presenting it to my master but where is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, he does,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Quirrell casually, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cheavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut I heard you a few days ago, sobbing   I thought Snape was threatening you. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSometimes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI find it hard to follow my master\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s instructions   he is a great wizard and I am weak  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou mean he was there in the classroom with you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry gasped. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe is with me wherever I go,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Quirrell quietly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Quirrell shivered suddenly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me decided he would have to keep a closer watch on  me. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley   how could he have been so stupid? He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron. Quirrell cursed under his breath. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t understand is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mind was racing. What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myself finding it   which means I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll see where it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m up to? He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And to Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUse the boy Use the boy. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Quirrell rounded on Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes   Potter   come here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCome here,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Quirrell repeated. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook in the mirror and tell me what you see.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry walked toward him. I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all. Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again. He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket   and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow   incredibly   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d gotten the Stone. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Quirrell impatiently. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat do you see?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry screwed up his courage. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he invented. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve won the house cup for Gryffindor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  Quirrell cursed again. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGet out of the way,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it? But he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t moving his lips. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe lies He lies. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cPotter, come back here!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Quirrell shouted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTell me the truth! What did you just see?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The high voice spoke again. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLet me speak to him face-to-face \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMaster, you are not strong enough!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have strength enough for this \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry felt as if Devil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot. Harry would have screamed, but he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry Potter \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d it whispered. Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t move. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee what I have become?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d the face said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMere shadow and vapor .I have form only when I can share another\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s body but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my own .Now why don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you give me that Stone in your pocket?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s legs. He stumbled backward. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be a fool,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d snarled the face. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBetter save your own life and join me or you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll meet the same end as your parents They died begging me for mercy \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLIAR!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry shouted suddenly. Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now smiling. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow touching \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d it hissed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI always value bravery .Yes, boy, your parents were brave I killed your father first; and he put up a courageous fight but your mother needn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have died she was trying to protect you Now  give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNEVER!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSEIZE HIM!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened   he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers   they were blistering before his eyes. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSeize him! SEIZE HIM!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet landing on top of him, both hands around Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s neck   Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMaster, I cannot hold him   my hands   my hands!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms   Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen kill him, fool, and be done!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d screeched Voldemort. Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face   \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAAAARGH!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain   his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse. Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off   the pain in Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head was building   he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see   he could only hear Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s terrible shrieks and Voldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s yells of, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cKILL HIM! KILL HIM!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d and other voices, maybe in Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s own head, crying, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry! Harry!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He felt Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down down  down . Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy. He blinked. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange. He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cGood afternoon, Harry,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got the Stone! Sir, quick  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCalm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuirrell does not have the Stone.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThen who does? Sir, I  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTokens from your friends and admirers,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore, beaming. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow long have I been in here?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThree days. Mr Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut sir, the Stone  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou got there? You got Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s owl?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWe must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt was you.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI feared I might be too late.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou nearly were, I couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have kept him off the Stone much longer \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot the Stone, boy, you   the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cDestroyed?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry blankly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut your friend   Nicolas Flamel  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, you know about Nicolas?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou did do the thing properly, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all for the best.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut that means he and his wife will die, won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t they?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes,  they will die.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cTo one as young as you, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all   the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSir?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been thinking sir   even if the Stone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cCall him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, sir. Well, Voldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to try other ways of coming back, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he? I mean, he hasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t gone, has he?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time   and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then he said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSir, there are some other things I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like to know, if you can tell me  things I want to know the truth about. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe truth.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dumbledore sighed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAlas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older I know you hate to hear this when you are ready, you will know.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut why couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t Quirrell touch me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYour mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t realize that love as powerful as your mother\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd the invisibility cloak   do you know who sent it to me?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh   your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes twinkled. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cUseful things your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s something else \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFire away.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cQuirrell said Snape  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProfessor Snape, Harry.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, him   Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe saved his life.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore dreamily. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFunny, the way people\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s minds work, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it? Professor Snape couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t bear being in your father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s debt I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s memory in peace. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd sir, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s one more thing \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust the one?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHow did I get the Stone out of the mirror?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAh, now, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone   find it, but not use it   would be able to get it, otherwise they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My  brain surprises even me sometimes Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m afraid I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve rather lost my liking for them   but I think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be safe with a nice toffee, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAlas! Ear wax!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cJust five minutes,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry pleaded. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAbsolutely not.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou let Professor Dumbledore in .\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, very well,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBut five minutes only.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d And she let Ron and Hermione in. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, Harry, we were sure you were going to   Dumbledore was so worried  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThe whole school\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s talking about it,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhat really happened?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s turban, Hermione screamed out loud. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo the Stone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron finally. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFlamel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just going to die?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that   what was it?    to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI always said he was off his rocker,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSo what happened to you two?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, I got back all right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI brought Ron round   that took a while   and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall   he already knew   he just said,  Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone after him, hasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and hurtled off to the third floor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cD\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99you think he meant you to do it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSending you your father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cloak and everything?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWell, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione exploded, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cif he did   I mean to say that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s terrible   you could have been killed.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNo, it isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry thoughtfully. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHe\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could .\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeah, Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s off his rocker, all right,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron proudly. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cListen, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course   you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you   but the food\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be good.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said firmly. After a good night\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal. I want to go to the feast,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. I can, can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t I?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cProfessor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said stiffly, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t realize how risky feasts could be. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd you have another visitor.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, good,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWho is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s   all   my   ruddy   fault!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d he sobbed, his face in his hands. I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I told him! Yeh could\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve died! All fer a dragon egg! I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll never drink again! I should be chucked out an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 made ter live as a Muggle!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHagrid, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re talking about, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have found out even if you hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t told him.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYeh could\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve died!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d sobbed Hagrid. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 say the name!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVOLDEMORT!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve met him and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone, he can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t use it. Have a Chocolate Frog,  I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got loads. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThat reminds me. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got yeh a present.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not a stoat sandwich, is it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it.  course, he shoulda sacked me instead   anyway, got yeh this. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSent owls off ter all yer parents\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 old school friends, askin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fer photos  knew yeh didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 have any d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99yeh like it?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak, but Hagrid understood. Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table. When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him. Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnother year gone!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dumbledore said cheerfully. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAnd I must trouble you with an old man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts.  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNow, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHowever, recent events must be taken into account.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d  The room went very still. The Slytherins\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 smiles faded a little. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cAhem,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cFirst   to Mr Ronald Weasley \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cMy brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s giant chess set!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d At last there was silence again. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSecond   to Miss Hermione Granger for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves   they were a hundred points up. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThird   to Mr Harry Potter \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9c for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points   exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup   if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point. Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere are all kinds of courage,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Dumbledore, smiling. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIt takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr Neville Longbottom.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have looked more stunned and horrified if he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cWhich means,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cwe need a little change of decoration.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering  Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s feelings toward him hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t changed one jot. This didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts. It was the best evening of Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls he would never, ever forget tonight. Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have everything in life. And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI always hope they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll forget to give us these,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Cross Station. It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou must come and stay this summer,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cboth of you   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll send you an owl.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThanks,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cI\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll need something to look forward to.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called: \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBye, Harry!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee you, Potter!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cStill famous,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Ron, grinning at him. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cNot where I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going, I promise you,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThere he  is, Mom, there he is, look!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It was Ginny Weasley, Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s younger sister, but she wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t pointing at Ron. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHarry Potter!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she squealed. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cLook, Mom! I can see  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBe quiet, Ginny, and it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s rude to point.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d Mrs Weasley smiled down at them. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cBusy year?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d she said. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cVery,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs Weasley.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, it was nothing, dear.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cReady, are you?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cYou must be Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s family!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Mrs Weasley. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cIn a manner of speaking,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Uncle Vernon. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHurry up, boy, we haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got all day.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d He walked away. Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cSee you over the summer, then.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cHope you have   er   a good holiday,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cOh, I will,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9d said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x9cThey don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not allowed to use magic at home. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer.

They were the last people you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t hold with such nonsense. Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sister, but they hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t met for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want Dudley mixing with a child like that. When Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair. None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window. At half past eight, Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. \"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s drive. It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar   a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr Dursley didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t realize what he had seen   then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive   no, looking at the sign; cats couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t read maps or signs. Mr Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t bear people who dressed in funny clothes   the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt  these people were obviously collecting for something yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. Mr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d for gotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying. \"The Potters, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s right, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what I heard  \"  \"   yes, their son, Harry  \" Mr Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it. He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blame her   if he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had a sister like that  but all the same, those people in cloaks.  He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. \"Sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\" And the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle and walked off. Mr Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t approve of imagination. As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw   and it didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t improve his mood   was the tabby cat he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. \"Shoo!\" said Mr Dursley loudly. The cat didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife. Mrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs Next Door\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\"Won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t!\"). Mr Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: \"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\" The newscaster allowed himself a grin. \"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\" \"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, \"I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know about that, but it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\" Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters.  Mrs Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \"Er   Petunia, dear   you haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t heard from your sister lately, have you?\" As he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have a sister. \"No,\" she said sharply. \"Why?\" \"Funny stuff on the news,\" Mr Dursley mumbled. \"Owls shooting stars and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today. \" \"So?\" snapped Mrs Dursley. \"Well, I just thought maybe it was something to do with you know her crowd.\" Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d heard the name \"Potter.\" He decided he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \"Their son   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be about Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s age now, wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he?\" \"I suppose so,\" said Mrs Dursley stiffly. \"What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s his name again? Howard, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\" \"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\" \"Oh, yes,\" said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \"Yes, I quite agree.\" He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something. Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did...if it got out that they were related to a pair of   well, he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think he could bear it. The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind....He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on   he yawned and turned over   it couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t affect them.  How very wrong he was. Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have thought he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just popped out of the ground. The cat\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed. Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name was Albus Dumbledore. Albus Dumbledore didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \"I should have known.\" He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again   the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs Dursley, they wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it. \"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\" He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled. \"How did you know it was me?\" she asked. \"My dear Professor, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\" \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be stiff if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been sitting on a brick wall all day,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\" Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily. \"Oh yes, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently. \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d think they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be a bit more careful, but no  even the Muggles have noticed something\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going on. It was on their news.\" She jerked her head back at the Dursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dark living-room window. \"I heard it. Flocks of owls shooting stars Well, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.\" \"You can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blame them,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.\" \"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably. \"But that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.\" She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, so she went on. \"A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?\" \"It certainly seems so,\" said Dumbledore. \"We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?\" \"A what?\" \"A lemon drop. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re a kind of Muggle sweet I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m rather fond of.\" \"No, thank you,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think this was the moment for lemon drops. \"As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone  \" \"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this  You-Know-Who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 nonsense   for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.\" Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. \"It all gets so confusing if we keep saying  You-KnowWho.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name.\" \"I know you haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \"But you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re different. Everyone knows you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.\" \"You flatter me,\" said Dumbledore calmly. \"Voldemort had powers I will never have.\" \"Only because you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re too   well   noble to use them.\" \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lucky it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dark. I haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\" Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said \"The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re saying? About why he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\" It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever \"everyone\" was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer. \"What they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re saying,\" she pressed on, \"is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are   are   that they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re   dead.\" Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped. \"Lily and James I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe it I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to believe it Oh, Albus \" Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \"I know I know \" he said heavily.  Professor McGonagall\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice trembled as she went on. \"That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not all. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re saying he tried to kill the Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s son, Harry. But he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re saying that when he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s power somehow broke   and that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone.\" Dumbledore nodded glumly. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s true?\" faltered Professor McGonagall. \"After all he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s done  all the people he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s killed he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t kill a little boy? It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just astounding of all the things to stop him but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\" \"We can only guess.\" said Dumbledore. \"We may never know.\" Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, \"Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s late. I suppose it was he who told you I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be here, by the way?\" \"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"And I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t suppose you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to tell me why you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re here, of all places?\" \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re the only family he has left now.\" \"You don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mean \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mean the people who live here?\" cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. \"Dumbledore   you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been watching them all day. You couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t find two people who are less like us. And they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got this son   I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!\" \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the best place for him,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s older. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve written them a letter.\" \"A letter?\" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. \"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be famous   a legend   I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future   there will be books written about Harry   every child in our world will know his name!\" \"Exactly.\" said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. \"It would be enough to turn any boy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even remember! Can you  see how much better off he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be, growing up away from all that until he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ready to take it?\" Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, \"Yes   yes, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?\" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it. \"Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s bringing him.\" \"You think it   wise   to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?\" \"I would trust Hagrid with my life,\" said Dumbledore. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not saying his heart isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t in the right place,\" said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, \"but you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t pretend he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not careless. He does tend to   what was that?\" A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky   and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them. If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild   long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets. \"Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \"At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?\" \"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\" said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. \"Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got him, sir.\" \"No problems, were there?\" \"No, sir   house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 around. He fell asleep as we was flyin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 over Bristol.\" Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jetblack hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning. \"Is that where  ?\" whispered Professor McGonagall. \"Yes,\" said Dumbledore. \"He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have that scar forever.\" \"Couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\"  \"Even if I could, I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well   give him here, Hagrid   we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better get this over with.\" Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 house. \"Could I   could I say good-bye to him, sir?\" asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog. \"Shhh!\" hissed Professor McGonagall, \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll wake the Muggles!\" \"S-s-sorry,\" sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. \"But I c-c-can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stand it  Lily an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 James dead   an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles  \" \"Yes, yes, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be found,\" Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes seemed to have gone out. \"Well,\" said Dumbledore finally, \"that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\" \"Yeah,\" said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be takin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Sirius his bike back. G\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99night, Professor McGonagall   Professor Dumbledore, sir.\" Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night. \"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\" said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply. Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four. \"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone. A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 time by Mrs Dursley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley....He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter   the boy who lived!\"   In early ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets   but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. \"Up! Get up! Now!\" Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. \"Up!\" she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had the same dream before. His aunt was back outside the door. \"Are you up yet?\" she demanded. \"Nearly,\" said Harry. \"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s birthday.\" Harry groaned. \"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door. \"Nothing, nothing \" Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s birthday   how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise   unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t often catch him. Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look it, but he was very fast. Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. \"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said. \"And don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ask questions.\" Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ask questions   that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys. Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon. \"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting. About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way   all over the place. Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel   Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell. \"Thirty-six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father. \"That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s two less than last year.\" \"Darling, you haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t counted Auntie Marge\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s present, see, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s here under this big one from Mummy and Daddy.\" \"All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \"And we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll buy you another two presents while we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re out today. How\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right\" Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, \"So I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have thirty...thirty...\" \"Thirty-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia. \"Oh.\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \"All right then.\" Uncle Vernon chuckled. \"Little tyke wants his money\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s worth, just like his father. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hair. At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried. \"Bad news, Vernon,\" she said. \"Mrs Figg\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s broken her leg. She can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t take him.\" She jerked her head in Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s direction. Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d ever owned. \"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr Paws, and Tufty again. \"We could phone Marge,\" Uncle Vernon suggested. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\" The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t there   or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t understand them, like a slug. \"What about what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s-her-name, your friend   Yvonne?\" \"On vacation in Majorca,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"You could just leave me here,\" Harry put in hopefully (he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s computer). Aunt Petunia looked as though she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just swallowed a lemon. \"And come back and find the house in ruins?\" she snarled. \"I won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blow up the house,\" said Harry, but they weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t listening. \"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\" said Aunt Petunia slowly, \"  and leave him in the car. \" \"That car\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s new, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not sitting in it alone. \" Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t really crying   it had been years since he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d really cried   but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted. \"Dinky Duddydums, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t cry, Mummy won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t let him spoil your special day!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him. \"I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want him t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. \"He always sp-spoils everything!\" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arms. Just then, the doorbell rang   \"Oh, good Lord, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re here!\" said Aunt Petunia frantically   and a moment later, Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m warning you now, boy   any funny business, anything at all   and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.\" \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly \" But Uncle Vernon didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe him. No one ever did. The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make them happen. Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t explain how it had grown back so quickly. Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t punished. On the other hand, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s surprise as anyone else\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump. But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t school, his cupboard, or Mrs Figg\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cabbage-smelling living room. While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles. \" roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\" he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. \"I had a dream about a motorcycle,\" said Harry, remembering suddenly. \"It was flying.\" Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \"MOTORCYCLES DON\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99T FLY!\" Dudley and Piers sniggered. \"I know they don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t,\" said Harry. \"It was only a dream.\" But he wished he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon   they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blond. Harry had the best morning he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s car and crushed it into a trash can   but at the moment it didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. \"Make it move,\" he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t budge. \"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. \"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself   no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. It winked. Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too. The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: \"I get that all the time.\" \"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sure the snake could hear him. \"It must be really annoying.\" The snake nodded vigorously. \"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked. The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it. Boa Constrictor, Brazil. \"Was it nice there?\" The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \"Oh, I see   so you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never been to Brazil?\" As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. \"DUDLEY! Mr DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99T BELIEVE WHAT IT\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99S DOING!\" Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. \"Out of the way, you,\" he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened   one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come.  Thanksss, amigo.\" The keeper of the reptile house was in shock. \"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\" The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you, Harry?\" Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, \"Go   cupboard   stay   no meals,\" before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what time it was and he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house. When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wildlooking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look. At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gang.  The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches. Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s favorite sport: Harry Hunting. This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny. \"They stuff people\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\" he told Harry. \"Want to come upstairs and practice?\" \"No, thanks,\" said Harry. \"The poor toilet\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s never had anything as horrible as your head down it   it might be sick.\" Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d said. One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs Figg\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. Mrs Figg wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t as bad as usual. It turned out she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had it for several years. That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life. As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.  There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water. \"What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s this?\" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question. \"Your new school uniform,\" she said. Harry looked in the bowl again. \"Oh,\" he said, \"I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t realize it had to be so wet.\" \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be stupid,\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m dyeing some of Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s old things gray for you. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll look just like everyone else\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s when I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve finished.\" Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High   like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably. Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table. They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat. \"Get the mail, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper. \"Make Harry get it.\" \"Get the mail, Harry.\" \"Make Dudley get it.\" \"Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.\" Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and   a letter for Harry. Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives   he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t belong to the library, so he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: Mr H. Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey  The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp. Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H. \"Hurry up, boy!\" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \"What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?\" He chuckled at his own joke. Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope. Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard. \"Marge\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ill,\" he informed Aunt Petunia. \"Ate a funny whelk. \" \"Dad!\" said Dudley suddenly. \"Dad, Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got something!\" Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon. \"That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mine!\" said Harry, trying to snatch it back. \"Who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be writing to you?\" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge. \"P-P-Petunia!\" he gasped. Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise. \"Vernon! Oh my goodness   Vernon!\" They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.  \"I want to read that letter,\" he said loudly. \"I want to read it,\" said Harry furiously, \"as it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mine.\" \"Get out, both of you,\" croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope. Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t move. \"I WANT MY LETTER!\" he shouted. \"Let me see it!\" demanded Dudley. \"OUT!\" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor. \"Vernon,\" Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \"look at the address   how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re watching the house?\" \"Watching   spying   might be following us,\" muttered Uncle Vernon wildly. \"But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want  \" Harry could see Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen. \"No,\" he said finally. \"No, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll ignore it. If they don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get an answer  Yes, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s best we won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do anything \" \"But  \" \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t we swear when we took him in we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?\" That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard. \"Where\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s my letter?\" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. \"Who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s writing to me?\" \"No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,\" said Uncle Vernon shortly. \"I have burned it.\" \"It was not a mistake,\" said Harry angrily, \"it had my cupboard on it.\" \"SILENCE!\" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful. \"Er   yes, Harry   about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re really getting a bit big for it we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s second bedroom. \"Why?\" said Harry. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ask questions!\" snapped his uncle. \"Take this stuff upstairs, now.\" The Dursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dog; in the corner was Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s first-ever television set, which he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never been touched. From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want him in there I need that room make him get out...\" Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have given anything to be up here. Today he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it. Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly. When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, \"There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s another one!  Mr H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive  \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\" With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s letter clutched in his hand. \"Go to your cupboard   I mean, your bedroom,\" he wheezed at Harry. \"Dudley   go   just go.\" Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t received his first letter. Surely that meant they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d try again? And this time he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d make sure they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t fail. He had a plan. The repaired alarm clock rang at six o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights. He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door   \"AAAAARRRGH!\" Harry leapt into the air; he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat   something alive! Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do exactly what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink. \"I want  \" he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes. Uncle Vernon didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot. \"See,\" he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \"if they can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t deliver them they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll just give up.\" \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not sure that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll work, Vernon.\" \"Oh, these people\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not like you and me,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him. On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom. Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back  doors so no one could go out. He hummed \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" as he worked, and jumped at small noises. On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor. \"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\" Dudley asked Harry in amazement. *** On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy. \"No post on Sundays,\" he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, \"no damn letters today  \" Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one   \"Out! OUT!\" Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor. \"That does it,\" said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. \"I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!\" He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag. They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while. \"Shake \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99em off shake \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99em off,\" he would mutter whenever he did this. They didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling.  He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d missed five television programs he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d wanted to see, and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer. Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering.  They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table. \"\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Scuse me, but is one of you Mr H. Potter? Only I got about an \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99undred of these at the front desk.\" She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address: Mr H. Potter Room 17 Railview Hotel Cokeworth Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll take them,\" said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room. *** \"Wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it be better just to go home, dear?\" Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage. \"Daddy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone mad, hasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he?\" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared. It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Monday,\" he told his mother. \"The Great Humberto\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.\" Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday   and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of  television   then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun   last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s old socks. Still, you weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t eleven every day. Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d bought. \"Found the perfect place!\" he said. \"Come on! Everyone out!\" It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there. \"Storm forecast for tonight!\" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. \"And this gentleman\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!\" A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve already got us some rations,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"so all aboard!\" It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house. The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms. Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up. \"Could do with some of those letters now, eh?\" he said cheerfully. He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t cheer him up at all. As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket. The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s snores were drowned by the low rolls  of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be eleven in ten minutes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now. Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be able to steal one somehow. Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea? One minute to go and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be eleven. Thirty seconds...twenty ten  nine   maybe he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him   three two one  BOOM. The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.   BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. \"Where\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the cannon?\" he said stupidly. There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them. \"Who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s there?\" he shouted. \"I warn you   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m armed!\" There was a pause. Then   SMASH! The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor. A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair. The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all. \"Couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make us a cup o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 tea, could yeh? It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not been an easy journey.  \" He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear. \"Budge up, yeh great lump,\" said the stranger. Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon. \"An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 here\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Harry!\" said the giant. Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. \"Las\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 time I saw you, you was only a baby,\" said the giant. \"Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got yer mom\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes.\" Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise. \"I demand that you leave at once, sir!\" he said. \"You are breaking and entering!\" \"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\" said the giant; he reached over  the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room. Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on. \"Anyway   Harry,\" said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, \"a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here   I mighta sat on it at some point, but it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll taste all right.\" From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing. Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, \"Who are you?\" The giant chuckled. \"True, I haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.\" He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s whole arm. \"What about that tea then, eh?\" he said, rubbing his hands together. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got it, mind.\" His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d sunk into a hot bath. The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.\" The giant chuckled darkly. \"Yer great puddin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 of a son don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 need fattenin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 anymore, Dursley, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 worry.\" He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sorry, but I still don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t really know who you are.\" The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his  hand. \"Call me Hagrid,\" he said, \"everyone does. An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 like I told yeh, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts   yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll know all about Hogwarts, o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 course. \"Er   no,\" said Harry. Hagrid looked shocked. \"Sorry,\" Harry said quickly. \"Sorry?\" barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t gettin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even know abou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Hogwarts, fer cryin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?\" \"All what?\" asked Harry. \"ALL WHAT?\" Hagrid thundered. \"Now wait jus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 one second!\" He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall. \"Do you mean ter tell me,\" he growled at the Dursleys, \"that this boy   this boy!   knows nothin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 abou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99   about ANYTHING?\" Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t bad. \"I know some things,\" he said. \"I can, you know, do math and stuff.\" But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, \"About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 world.\" \"What world?\" Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode. \"DURSLEY!\" he boomed. Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like \"Mimblewimble.\" Hagrid stared wildly at Harry. \"But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,\" he said. \"I mean, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re famous. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re famous.\" \"What? My   my mom and dad weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t famous, were they?\" \"Yeh don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 know...yeh don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 know....\" Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare. \"Yeh don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 know what yeh are?\" he said finally. Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice. \"Stop!\" he commanded. \"Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!\" A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage. \"You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore  left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve kept it from him all these years?\" \"Kept what from me?\" said Harry eagerly. \"STOP! I FORBID YOU!\" yelled Uncle Vernon in panic. Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror. \"Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,\" said Hagrid. \"Harry   yer a wizard.\" There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m a what?\" gasped Harry. \"A wizard, o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 course,\" said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, \"an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 a thumpin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 good  un, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d say, once yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I reckon it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s abou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 time yeh read yer letter.\" Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards) Dear Mr Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31. Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress Questions exploded inside Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head like fireworks and he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, \"What does it mean, they await my owl?\" \"Gallopin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Gorgons, that reminds me,\" said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another  pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl   a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl   a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry his letter. Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. Weather\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s horrible. Hope you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re well. Hagrid Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone. Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly. \"Where was I?\" said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight. \"He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not going,\" he said. Hagrid grunted. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,\" he said. \"A what?\" said Harry, interested. \"A Muggle,\" said Hagrid, \"it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s your bad luck you grew up in a family o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.\" \"We swore when we took him in we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d put a stop to that rubbish,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"swore we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!\" \"You knew?\" said Harry. \"You knew I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m a   a wizard?\" \"Knew!\" shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. \"Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that   that school   and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was   a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!\" She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years. \"Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be just the same, just as strange, just as   as   abnormal   and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!\"  Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, \"Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!\" \"CAR CRASH!\" roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. \"How could a car crash kill Lily an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 James Potter? It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!\" \"But why? What happened?\" Harry asked urgently. The anger faded from Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face. He looked suddenly anxious. \"I never expected this,\" he said, in a low, worried voice. \"I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 hold of yeh, how much yeh didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know. Ah, Harry, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 know if I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m the right person ter tell yeh   but someone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gotta   yeh can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99.\" He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys. \"Well, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh   mind, I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell yeh everythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a great myst\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ry, parts of it. \" He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, \"It begins, I suppose, with   with a person called   but it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s incredible yeh don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know his name, everyone in our world knows  \" \"Who?\" \"Well   I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 like sayin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the name if I can help it. No one does.\" \"Why not?\" \"Gulpin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went ...bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was...\" Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. \"Could you write it down?\" Harry suggested. \"Nah   can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t spell it. All right   Voldemort. \" Hagrid shuddered. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 make me say it again. Anyway, this   this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fer followers. Got  em, too   some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 his power,  cause he was gettin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know who ter trust, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches terrible things happened. He was takin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 over.  Course, some stood up to him   an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he killed  em. Horribly. One o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t dare try takin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the school, not jus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 then, anyway. \"Now, yer mum an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dad were as good a witch an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ry is why YouKnow-Who never tried to get  em on his side before probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ter do with the Dark Side.  \"Maybe he thought he could persuade  em...maybe he just wanted  em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99   an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99  \" Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"But it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that sad   knew yer mum an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dad, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 nicer people yeh couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t find   anyway . \"You-Know-Who killed  em. An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 then   an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 this is the real myst\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ry of the thing   he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 by then. But he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh   took care of yer mum an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dad an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 yer house, even   but it didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t work on you, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99em, no one except you, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d killed some o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the best witches an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 wizards of the age   the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts   an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you was only a baby, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you lived.\" Something very painful was going on in Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mind. As Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before   and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh. Hagrid was watching him sadly. \"Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot .\" \"Load of old tosh,\" said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched. \"Now, you listen here, boy,\" he snarled, \"I accept there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have cured   and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdoes, no denying it, and the world\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s better off without them in my opinion   asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types   just what I expected, always knew they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d come to a sticky end  \" But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m warning you, Dursley   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m warning you   one more word .\" In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent.  \"That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s better,\" said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor. Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them. \"But what happened to Vol-, sorry   I mean, You-Know-Who?\" \"Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the biggest myst\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ry, see he was gettin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 more an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 more powerful   why\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d he go? \"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s still out there, bidin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 his time, like, but I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of  em came outta kinda trances. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 reckon they could\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve done if he was comin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 back. \"Most of us reckon he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Cause somethin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 goin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 on that night he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t counted on   I dunno what it was, no one does   but somethin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 about you stumped him, all right.\" Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t they been turned into warty toads every time they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football? \"Hagrid,\" he said quietly, \"I think you must have made a mistake. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think I can be a wizard.\" To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled. \"Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?\" Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry chased by Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d managed to make it grow back...and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he set a boa constrictor on him? Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him. \"See?\" said Hagrid. \"Harry Potter, not a wizard   you wait, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be  right famous at Hogwarts.\" But Uncle Vernon wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to give in without a fight. \"Haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t I told you he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not going?\" he hissed. \"He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to Stonewall High and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be grateful for it. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish   spell books and wands and  \" \"If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop him,\" growled Hagrid. \"Stop Lily an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 James Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s son goin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s been down ever since he was born. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know himself. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled \" \"I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!\" yelled Uncle Vernon. But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, \"NEVER  \" he thundered, \"  INSULT   ALBUS   DUMBLEDORE   IN   FRONT   OF   ME!\" He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley   there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s tail poking through a hole in his trousers. Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them. Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard. \"Shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ta lost me temper,\" he said ruefully, \"but it didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t much left ter do.\" He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows. \"Be grateful if yeh didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,\" he said. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m   er   not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 get yer letters to yeh an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 stuff   one o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job.\" \"Why aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you supposed to do magic?\" asked Harry. \"Oh, well   I was at Hogwarts meself but I   er   got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.\" \"Why were you expelled?\" \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gettin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 late and we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got lots ter do tomorrow,\" said Hagrid loudly.  \"Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 that.\" He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry. \"You can kip under that,\" he said. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 doormice in one o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the pockets.\"  Harry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight. \"It was a dream, he told himself firmly. \"I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be at home in my cupboard.\" There was suddenly a loud tapping noise. And there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream. Tap. Tap. Tap. \"All right,\" Harry mumbled, \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m getting up.\" He sat up and Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak. Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coat. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do that.\" Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat. \"Hagrid!\" said Harry loudly. \"There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s an owl  \" \"Pay him,\" Hagrid grunted into the sofa. \"What?\" \"He wants payin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fer deliverin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the paper. Look in the pockets.\" Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets   bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags...finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins. \"Give him five Knuts,\" said Hagrid sleepily. \"Knuts?\" \"The little bronze ones.\" Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so  Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window. Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched. \"Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 buy all yer stuff fer school.\" Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture. \"Um   Hagrid?\" \"Mm?\" said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots. \"I haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got any money   and you heard Uncle Vernon last night he won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t pay for me to go and learn magic.\" \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t worry about that,\" said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. \"D\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99yeh think yer parents didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t leave yeh anything?\" \"But if their house was destroyed  \" \"They didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 bank. Have a sausage, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not bad cold   an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 say no teh a bit o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 yer birthday cake, neither.\" \"Wizards have banks?\" \"Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.\" Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. \"Goblins?\" \"Yeah   so yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be mad ter try an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 rob it, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe    cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.\" Hagrid drew himself up proudly. \"He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you   gettin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 things from Gringotts   knows he can trust me, see.\" \"Got everythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99? Come on, then.\" Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm. \"How did you get here?\" Harry asked, looking around for another boat. \"Flew,\" said Hagrid. \"Flew?\" \"Yeah   but we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll go back in this. Not s\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99pposed ter use magic now I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got yeh.\" They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.  \"Seems a shame ter row, though,\" said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. \"If I was ter   er   speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 it at Hogwarts?\" \"Of course not,\" said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land. \"Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?\" Harry asked. \"Spells   enchantments,\" said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. \"They say there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dragons guardin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the high security vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way   Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d die of hunger tryin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.\" Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never had so many questions in his life. \"Ministry o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Magic messin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 things up as usual,\" Hagrid muttered, turning the page. \"There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a Ministry of Magic?\" Harry asked, before he could stop himself. \"\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Course,\" said Hagrid. \"They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 course, but he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fer advice.\" \"But what does a Ministry of Magic do?\" \"Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s still witches an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 wizards up an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 down the country.\" \"Why?\" \"Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be wantin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re best left alone.\" At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street. Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, \"See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?\" \"Hagrid,\" said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, \"did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?\" \"Well, so they say,\" said Hagrid. \"Crikey, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like a dragon.\"  \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like one?\" \"Wanted one ever since I was a kid   here we go.\" They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 time. Hagrid, who didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t understand \"Muggle money,\" as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets. People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent. \"Still got yer letter, Harry?\" he asked as he counted stitches. Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket. \"Good,\" said Hagrid. \"There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a list there of everything yeh need.\" Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t noticed the night before, and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL o f WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY UNIFORM First-year students will require: 1. Three sets of plain work robes (black) 2. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear 3. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar) 4. One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings) Please note that all pupils\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 clothes should carry name tags COURSE BOOKS All students should have a copy of each of the following: The Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling A Beginners\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Guide to Transfiguration by Emeric Switch One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore Magical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection by Quentin Trimble OTHER EQUIPMENT 1 wand 1 cauldron (pewter, standard size 2) 1 set of glass or crystal phials 1 telescope set 1 brass scales  Students may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad PARENTS ARE REMINDED THAT FIRST YEARS ARE NOT ALLOWED THEIR OWN BROOMSTICKS \"Can we buy all this in London?\" Harry wondered aloud. \"If yeh know where to go,\" said Hagrid. Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow. \"I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know how the Muggles manage without magic,\" he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops. Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help trusting him. \"This is it,\" said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \"the Leaky Cauldron. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a famous place.\" It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t pointed it out, Harry wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside. For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, \"The usual, Hagrid?\" \"Can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, Tom, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m on Hogwarts business,\" said Hagrid, clapping his great  hand on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shoulder and making Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s knees buckle. \"Good Lord,\" said the bartender, peering at Harry, \"is this   can this be  ?\" The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent. \"Bless my soul,\" whispered the old bartender, \"Harry Potter what an honor.\" He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes. \"Welcome back, Mr Potter, welcome back.\" Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming. Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron. \"Doris Crockford, Mr Potter, can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m meeting you at last.\" \"So proud, Mr Potter, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m just so proud.\" \"Always wanted to shake your hand   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m all of a flutter.\" \"Delighted, Mr Potter, just can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell you, Diggle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the name, Dedalus Diggle.\" \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve seen you before!\" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s top hat fell off in his excitement. \"You bowed to me once in a shop.\" \"He remembers!\" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. \"Did you hear that? He remembers me!\" Harry shook hands again and again   Doris Crockford kept coming back for more. A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching. \"Professor Quirrell!\" said Hagrid. \"Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.\" \"P-P-Potter,\" stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand, \"ccan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.\" \"What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\" \"D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\" muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d rather not think about it. \"N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?\" He laughed nervously. \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.\" He looked terrified at the very thought. But the others wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.  \"Must get on   lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.\" Doris Crockford shook Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds. Hagrid grinned at Harry. \"Told yeh, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ter meet yeh   mind you, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s usually tremblin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99.\" \"Is he always that nervous?\" \"Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience....They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 trouble with a hag   never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject   now, where\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s me umbrella?\" Vampires? Hags? Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can. \"Three up two across \" he muttered. \"Right, stand back, Harry.\" He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella. The brick he had touched quivered   it wriggled   in the middle, a small hole appeared   it grew wider and wider   a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight. \"Welcome,\" said Hagrid, \"to Diagon Alley.\" He grinned at Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall. The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons   All Sizes   Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver   Self-Stirring   Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them. \"Yeah, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be needin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 one,\" said Hagrid, \"but we gotta get yer money first.\" Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \"Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re mad. \" A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium   Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. \"Look,\" Harry heard one of them say, \"the new Nimbus Two Thousand    fastest ever  \" There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon.  \"Gringotts,\" said Hagrid. They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was   \"Yeah, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a goblin,\" said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: Enter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn. So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there. \"Like I said, Yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be mad ter try an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 rob it,\" said Hagrid. A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter. \"Morning,\" said Hagrid to a free goblin. \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve come ter take some money outta Mr Harry Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s safe.\" \"You have his key, sir?\" \"Got it here somewhere,\" said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals. \"Got it,\" said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key. The goblin looked at it closely. \"That seems to be in order.\"  \"An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.\" The goblin read the letter carefully. \"Very well,\" he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \"I will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!\" Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall. \"What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\" Harry asked. \"Can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell yeh that,\" said Hagrid mysteriously. \"Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s trusted me. More\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99n my job\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s worth ter tell yeh that.\" Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in   Hagrid with some difficulty   and were off. At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t steering. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late   they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor. \"I never know,\" Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \"what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\" \"Stalagmite\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got an  m\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 in it,\" said Hagrid. \"An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 ask me questions just now, I think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m gonna be sick.\" He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling. Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts. \"All yours,\" smiled Hagrid. All Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s   it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have known  about this or they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London. Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. \"The gold ones are Galleons,\" he explained. \"Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 terms, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll keep the rest safe for yeh.\" He turned to Griphook. \"Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?\" \"One speed only,\" said Griphook. They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck. Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. \"Stand back,\" said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. \"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,\" said Griphook. \"How often do you check to see if anyone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s inside?\" Harry asked. \"About once every ten years,\" said Griphook with a rather nasty grin. Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least   but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask. \"Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t talk to me on the way back, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s best if I keep me mouth shut,\" said Hagrid. One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had in his whole life   more money than even Dudley had ever had. \"Might as well get yer uniform,\" said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Robes for All Occasions. \"Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.\" He did  still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shop alone, feeling nervous. Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve. \"Hogwarts, dear?\" she said, when Harry started to speak. \"Got the lot here   another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.\" In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length. \"Hello,\" said the boy, \"Hogwarts, too?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry. \"My father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s next door buying my books and mother\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s up the street looking at wands,\" said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. \"Then I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see why first years can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have their own. I think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll bully father into getting me one and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll smuggle it in somehow.\" Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley. \"Have you got your own broom?\" the boy went on. \"No,\" said Harry. \"Play Quidditch at all?\" \"No,\" Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be. \"I do   Father says it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a crime if I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be in yet?\" \"No,\" said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. \"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been   imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d leave, wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you?\" \"Mmm,\" said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting. \"I say, look at that man!\" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t come in. \"That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Hagrid,\" said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. \"He works at Hogwarts.\" \"Oh,\" said the boy, \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve heard of him. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a sort of servant, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he?\" \"He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the gamekeeper,\" said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second. \"Yes, exactly. I heard he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a sort of savage   lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up  setting fire to his bed.\" \"I think he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s brilliant,\" said Harry coldly. \"Do you?\" said the boy, with a slight sneer. \"Why is he with you? Where are your parents?\" \"They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re dead,\" said Harry shortly. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel much like going into the matter with this boy. \"Oh, sorry,\" said the other, not sounding sorry at all. \"But they were our kind, weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t they?\" \"They were a witch and wizard, if that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what you mean.\" \"I really don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re just not the same, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s your surname, anyway?\" But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \"That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s you done, my dear,\" and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool. \"Well, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\" said the drawling boy. Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts). \"What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s up?\" said Hagrid. \"Nothing,\" Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, \"Hagrid, what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Quidditch?\" \"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 how little yeh know   not knowin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 about Quidditch!\" \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make me feel worse,\" said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. \"  and he said people from Muggle families shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even be allowed in  \" \"Yer not from a Muggle family. If he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d known who yeh were   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s grown up knowin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 yer name if his parents are wizardin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in  em in a long line o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Muggles   look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!\" \"So what is Quidditch?\" \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s our sport. Wizard sport. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s like   like soccer in the Muggle world   everyone follows Quidditch   played up in the air on broomsticks and there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s four balls   sorta hard ter explain the rules.\"  \"And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?\" \"School houses. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 duffers, but  \" \"I bet I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m in Hufflepuff,\" said Harry gloomily. \"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\" said Hagrid darkly. \"There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.\" \"Vol-, sorry  You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\" \"Years an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 years ago,\" said Hagrid. They bought Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian. \"I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.\" \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not sayin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,\" said Hagrid. \"An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 anyway, yeh couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 work any of them curses yet, yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.\" Hagrid wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\"It says pewter on yer list\"), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s list again. \"Just yer wand left   A yeah, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I still haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got yeh a birthday present.\" Harry felt himself go red. \"You don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have to  \" \"I know I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have to. Tell yeh what, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get yer animal. Not a toad,  toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be laughed at   an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 like cats, they make me sneeze. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re dead useful, carry yer mail an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 everythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99.\" Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 mention it,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 expect you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now   only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.\" A magic wand this was what Harry had been really looking forward to. The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic. \"Good afternoon,\" said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair. An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop. \"Hello,\" said Harry awkwardly. \"Ah yes,\" said the man. \"Yes, yes. I thought I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.\" It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a question. \"You have your mother\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.\" Mr Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. \"Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.\" Mr Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.  \"And that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s where \" Mr Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s forehead with a long, white finger. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\" he said softly. \"Thirteenand-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands well, if I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d known what that wand was going out into the world to do.  \" He shook his head and then, to Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s relief, spotted Hagrid. \"Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again. Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\" \"It was, sir, yes,\" said Hagrid. \"Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?\" said Mr Ollivander, suddenly stern. \"Er   yes, they did, yes,\" said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve still got the pieces, though,\" he added brightly. \"But you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t use them?\" said Mr Ollivander sharply. \"Oh, no, sir,\" said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. \"Hmmm,\" said Mr Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. \"Well, now   Mr Potter. Let me see.\" He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. \"Which is your wand arm?\" \"Er   well, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m right-handed,\" said Harry. \"Hold out your arm. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s it.\" He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, \"Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wand.\" Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes. \"That will do,\" he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. \"Right then, Mr Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave.\" Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once. \"Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try  \" Harry tried   but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was  snatched back by Mr Ollivander. \"No, no   here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.\" Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become. \"Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll find the perfect match here somewhere   I wonder, now   yes, why not   unusual combination   holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.\" Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr Ollivander cried, \"Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well how curious how very curious \" He put Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, \"Curious curious  \"Sorry,\" said Harry, \"but what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s curious?\" Mr Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. \"I remember every wand I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve ever sold, Mr Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather   just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother   why, its brother gave you that scar.\" Harry swallowed. \"Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember I think we must expect great things from you, Mr Potter .After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things   terrible, yes, but great.\" Harry shivered. He wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sure he liked Mr Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr Ollivander bowed them from his shop. The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington  station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder. \"Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\" he said. He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow. \"You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\" said Hagrid. Harry wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sure he could explain. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just had the best birthday of his life   and yet   he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words. \"Everyone thinks I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m special,\" he said at last. \"All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr Ollivander but I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m famous and I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even remember what I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m famous for. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what happened when Vol-, sorry   I mean, the night my parents died.\" Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you worry, Harry. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hard. Yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been singled out, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s always hard. But yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have a great time at Hogwarts   I did   still do, \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99smatter of fact.\" Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope. \"Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, \" he said. \"First o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 September   King\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Cross   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll know where to find me .See yeh soon, Harry.\" The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.  Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s last month with the Dursleys wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him   in fact, they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while. Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first. On the last day of August he thought he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room. \"Er   Uncle Vernon?\" Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening. \"Er   I need to be at King\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Cross tomorrow to   to go to Hogwarts.\" Uncle Vernon grunted again. \"Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?\" Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes. \"Thank you.\" He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke. \"Funny way to get to a wizards\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?\" Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say anything. \"Where is this school, anyway?\"  \"I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know,\" said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket. \"I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock,\" he read. His aunt and uncle stared. \"Platform what?\" \"Nine and three-quarters.\" \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t talk rubbish,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"There is no platform nine and three-quarters.\" \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s on my ticket.\" \"Barking,\" said Uncle Vernon, \"howling mad, the lot of them. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll see. You just wait. All right, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll take you to King\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Cross. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t bother.\" \"Why are you going to London?\" Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly. \"Taking Dudley to the hospital,\" growled Uncle Vernon. \"Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.\" Harry woke at five o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to walk into the station in his wizard\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s robes   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off. They reached King\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face. \"Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine   platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem to have built it yet, do they?\" He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all. \"Have a good term,\" said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was  he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have to ask someone. He stopped a passing guard, but didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock, but the guard said there wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl. Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s stand between platforms nine and ten. At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying. \"  packed with Muggles, of course  \" Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s in front of him   and they had an owl. Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying. \"Now, what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the platform number?\" said the boys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 mother. \"Nine and three-quarters!\" piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was holding her hand, \"Mom, can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t I go \" \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first.\" What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it   but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished. \"Fred, you next,\" the plump woman said. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not Fred, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m George,\" said the boy. \"Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you tell I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m George?\" \"Sorry, George, dear.\" \"Only joking, I am Fred,\" said the boy, and off he went. His twin called  after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone   but how had he done it? Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there   and then, quite suddenly, he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t anywhere. There was nothing else for it. \"Excuse me,\" Harry said to the plump woman. \"Hello, dear,\" she said. \"First time at Hogwarts? Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s new, too.\" She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose. \"Yes,\" said Harry. \"The thing is   the thing is, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know how to  \" \"How to get onto the platform?\" she said kindly, and Harry nodded. \"Not to worry,\" she said. \"All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop and don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be scared you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll crash into it, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.\" \"Er   okay,\" said Harry. He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid. He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be in trouble   leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run   the barrier was coming nearer and nearer   he wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be able to stop   the cart was out of control   he was a foot away   he closed his eyes ready for the crash   It didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t come he kept on running he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Express, eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it. Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks. The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, \"Gran, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve lost my toad again.\" \"Oh, Neville,\" he heard the old woman sigh. A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.  \"Give us a look, Lee, go on.\" The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg. Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot. \"Want a hand?\" It was one of the red-haired twins he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d followed through the barrier. \"Yes, please,\" Harry panted. \"Oy, Fred! C\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99mere and help!\" With the twins\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 help, Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment. \"Thanks,\" said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes. \"What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that?\" said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lightning scar. \"Blimey,\" said the other twin. \"Are you  ?\" \"He is,\" said the first twin. \"Aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you?\" he added to Harry. \"What?\" said Harry. \"Harry Potter.\" chorused the twins. \"Oh, him,\" said Harry. \"I mean, yes, I am.\" The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s open door. \"Fred? George? Are you there?\" \"Coming, Mom.\" With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train. Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief. \"Ron, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got something on your nose.\" The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose. \"Mom   geroff\" He wriggled free. \"Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?\" said one of the twins. \"Shut up,\" said Ron. \"Where\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Percy?\" said their mother. \"He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coming now.\"  The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it. \"Can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stay long, Mother,\" he said. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves  \" \"Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?\" said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. \"You should have said something, we had no idea.\" \"Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,\" said the other twin. \"Once  \" \"Or twice  \" \"A minute  \" \"All summer  \" \"Oh, shut up,\" said Percy the Prefect. \"How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?\" said one of the twins. \"Because he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a prefect,\" said their mother fondly. \"All right, dear, well, have a good term   send me an owl when you get there.\" She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins. \"Now, you two   this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve   you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve blown up a toilet or  \" \"Blown up a toilet? We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never blown up a toilet.\" \"Great idea though, thanks, Mom.\" \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not funny. And look after Ron.\" \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.\" \"Shut up,\" said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it. \"Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?\" Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see him looking. \"You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?\" \"Who?\" \"Harry Potter!\" Harry heard the little girl\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice. \"Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please....\" \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?\" \"Asked him. Saw his scar. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really there   like lightning.\" \"Poor dear   no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.\" \"Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who  looks like?\" Their mother suddenly became very stern. \"I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.\" \"All right, keep your hair on.\" A whistle sounded. \"Hurry up!\" their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, Ginny, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll send you loads of owls.\" \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll send you a Hogwarts\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 toilet seat.\" \"George!\" \"Only joking, Mom.\" The train began to move. Harry saw the boys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved. Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what he was going to   but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind. The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in. \"Anyone sitting there?\" he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. \"Everywhere else is full.\" Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose. \"Hey, Ron.\" The twins were back. \"Listen, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going down the middle of the train   Lee Jordan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got a giant tarantula down there.\" \"Right,\" mumbled Ron. \"Harry,\" said the other twin, \"did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.\" \"Bye,\" said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them. \"Are you really Harry Potter?\" Ron blurted out. Harry nodded. \"Oh   well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s jokes,\" said  Ron. \"And have you really got   you know \" He pointed at Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s forehead. Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared. \"So that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s where You-Know-Who  ?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry, \"but I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t remember it.\" \"Nothing?\" said Ron eagerly. \"Well   I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.\" \"Wow,\" said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again. \"Are all your family wizards?\" asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him. \"Er   Yes, I think so,\" said Ron. \"I think Mom\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got a second cousin who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s an accountant, but we never talk about him.\" \"So you must know loads of magic already.\" The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about. \"I heard you went to live with Muggles,\" said Ron. \"What are they like?\" \"Horrible   well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had three wizard brothers.\" \"Five,\" said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left   Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got Bill\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s old robes, Charlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s old wand, and Percy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s old rat.\" Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep. \"His name\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Scabbers and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t aff   I mean, I got Scabbers instead.\" Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ears went pink. He seemed to think he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window. Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.  \" and until Hagrid told me, I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort  \" Ron gasped. \"What?\" said Harry. \"You said You-Know-Who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name!\" said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have thought you, of all people  \" \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\" said Harry, \"I just never knew you shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. See what I mean? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got loads to learn. I bet,\" he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, \"I bet I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m the worst in the class.\" \"You won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.\" While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past. Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, \"Anything off the cart, dears?\" Harry, who hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ears went pink again and he muttered that he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor. He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry   but the woman didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts. Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat. \"Hungry, are you?\" \"Starving,\" said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty. Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, \"She always forgets I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t like corned beef..\" \"Swap you for one of these,\" said Harry, holding up a pasty. \"Go on  \" \"You don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want this, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all dry,\" said Ron. \"She hasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got much time,\" he added quickly, \"you know, with five of us.\"  \"Go on, have a pasty,\" said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten). \"What are these?\" Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. \"They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not really frogs, are they?\" He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him. \"No,\" said Ron. \"But see what the card is. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m missing Agrippa.\" \"What?\" \"Oh, of course, you wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know   Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect   famous witches and wizards. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got about five hundred, but I haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.\" Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore. \"So this is Dumbledore!\" said Harry. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell me you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never heard of Dumbledore!\" said Ron. \"Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa   thanks  \" Harry turned over his card and read: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS C onsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling. Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face had disappeared. \"He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone!\" \"Well, you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t expect him to hang around all day,\" said Ron. \"He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be back. No, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got Morgana again and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got about six of her do you want it? You can start collecting.\" Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped. \"Help yourself,\" said Harry. \"But in, you know, the Muggle world,  people just stay put in photos.\" \"Do they? What, they don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t move at all?\" Ron sounded amazed. \"Weird!\" Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the Druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Every Flavor Beans. \"You want to be careful with those,\" Ron warned Harry. \"When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor   you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.\" Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner. \"Bleaaargh   see? Sprouts.\" They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t touch, which turned out to be pepper. The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills. There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked tearful. \"Sorry,\" he said, \"but have you seen a toad at all?\" When they shook their heads, he wailed, \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve lost him! He keeps getting away from me!\" \"He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll turn up,\" said Harry. \"Yes,\" said the boy miserably. \"Well, if you see him \" He left. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know why he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s so bothered,\" said Ron. \"If I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d brought a toad I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t talk.\" The rat was still snoozing on Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lap. \"He might have died and you wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know the difference,\" said Ron in disgust. \"I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t work. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll show you, look \" He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking  wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end. \"Unicorn hair\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nearly poking out. Anyway  \" He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes. \"Has anyone seen a toad? Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lost one,\" she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth. \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve already told him we haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seen it,\" said Ron, but the girl wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand. \"Oh, are you doing magic? Let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s see it, then.\" She sat down. Ron looked taken aback. \"Er   all right.\" He cleared his throat. \"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\" He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep. \"Are you sure that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a real spell?\" said the girl. \"Well, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not very good, is it? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all worked for me. Nobody in my family\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve heard   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?\" She said all this very fast. Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t learned all the course books by heart either. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m Ron Weasley,\" Ron muttered. \"Harry Potter,\" said Harry. \"Are you really?\" said Hermione. \"I know all about you, of course   I got a few extra books, for background reading, and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.\" \"Am I?\" said Harry, feeling dazed. \"Goodness, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you know, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have found out everything I could if it was me,\" said Hermione. \"Do either of you know what house you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be in? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been asking around, and I hope I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I  hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be too bad....Anyway, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better go and look for Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be there soon.\" And she left, taking the toadless boy with her. \"Whatever house I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m in, I hope she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not in it,\" said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. \"Stupid spell   George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.\" \"What house are your brothers in?\" asked Harry. \"Gryffindor,\" said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. \"Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll say if I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.\" \"That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?\" \"Yeah,\" said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed. \"You know, I think the ends of Scabbers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 whiskers are a bit lighter,\" said Harry, trying to take Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mind off houses. \"So what do your oldest brothers do now that they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve left, anyway?\" Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d finished school. \"Charlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,\" said Ron. \"Did you hear about Gringotts? It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t suppose you get that with the Muggles   someone tried to rob a high security vault.\" Harry stared. \"Really? What happened to them?\" \"Nothing, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s such big news. They haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been caught. My dad says it must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think they took anything, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s odd. \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s behind it.\" Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying \"Voldemort\" without worrying. \"What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s your Quidditch team?\" Ron asked. \"Er   I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know any.\" Harry confessed. \"What!\" Ron looked dumbfounded. \"Oh, you wait, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the best game in the world  \" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger  this time. Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d shown back in Diagon Alley. \"Is it true?\" he said. \"They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re saying all down the train that Harry Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s in this compartment. So it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s you, is it?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards. \"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\" said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. \"And my name\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.\" Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him. \"Think my name\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.\" He turned back to Harry. \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.\" He held out his hand to shake Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, but Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t take it. \"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\" he said coolly. Draco Malfoy didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be careful if I were you, Potter,\" he said slowly. \"Unless you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re a bit politer you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll go the same way as your parents. They didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll rub off on you.\" Both Harry and Ron stood up. \"Say that again,\" Ron said, his face as red as his hair. \"Oh, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to fight us, are you?\" Malfoy sneered. \"Unless you get out now,\" said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron. \"But we don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.\" Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron   Ron leapt forward, but before he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell. Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s knuckle   Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit  the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in. \"What has been going on?\" she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail. \"I think he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s been knocked out,\" Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. \"No   I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe it   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone back to sleep.\" And so he had. \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve met Malfoy before?\" Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve heard of his family,\" said Ron darkly. \"They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been bewitched. My dad doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe it. He says Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s father didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.\" He turned to Hermione. \"Can we help you with something?\" \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better hurry up and put your robes on, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re nearly there. You haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been fighting, have you? You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be in trouble before we even get there!\" \"Scabbers has been fighting, not us,\" said Ron, scowling at her. \"Would you mind leaving while we change?\" \"All right   I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,\" said Hermione in a sniffy voice. \"And you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?\" Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down. He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them. A voice echoed through the train: \"We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.\" Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor. The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: \"Firs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 years! Firs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 years over here! All right there, Harry?\"  Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads. \"C\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99mon, follow me   any more firs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 years? Mind yer step, now! Firs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 years follow me!\" Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice. \"Yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get yer firs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 sight o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Hogwarts in a sec,\" Hagrid called over his shoulder, \"jus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 round this bend here.\" There was a loud \"Oooooh!\" The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers. \"No more\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99n four to a boat!\" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione. \"Everyone in?\" shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. \"Right then   FORWARD!\" And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood. \"Heads down!\" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles. \"Oy, you there! Is this your toad?\" said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them. \"Trevor!\" cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle. They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door. \"Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?\" Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.  The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s first thought was that this was not someone to cross. \"The firs\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid. \"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\" She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors. They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right   the rest of the school must already be here   but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously. \"Welcome to Hogwarts,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room. \"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours. \"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.\" Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten  his hair. \"I shall return when we are ready for you,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Please wait quietly.\" She left the chamber. Harry swallowed. \"How exactly do they sort us into houses?\" he asked Ron. \"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.\" Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know any magic yet  what on earth would he have to do? He hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d learned and wondering which one she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never been more nervous, never, not even when he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d somehow turned his teacher\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom. Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air   several people behind him screamed. \"What the  ?\" He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: \"Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance  \" \"My dear Friar, haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not really even a ghost   I say, what are you all doing here?\" A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years. Nobody answered. \"New students!\" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \"About to be Sorted, I suppose?\" A few people nodded mutely. \"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\" said the Friar. \"My old house, you know.\" \"Move along now,\" said a sharp voice. \"The Sorting Ceremony\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s about to start.\" Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.  \"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and follow me.\" Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall. Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, \"Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.\" It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t simply open on to the heavens. Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have let it in the house. Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing   noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth   and the hat began to sing: \"Oh, you may not think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m pretty, But don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t judge on what you see, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me. You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothing hidden in your head  The Sorting Hat can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be. You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends. So put me on! Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be afraid! And don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get in a flap! You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re in safe hands (though I have none) For I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m a Thinking Cap!\" The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again. \"So we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve just got to try on the hat!\" Ron whispered to Harry. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\" Harry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him. Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment. \"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\" she said. \"Abbott, Hannah!\" A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause    \"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat. The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her. \"Bones, Susan!\" \"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah. \"Boot, Terry!\" \"RAVENCLAW!\" The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them. \"Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s twin brothers catcalling. \"Bulstrode, Millicent\" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s imagination, after all he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him. \"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!\" \"HUFFLEPUFF!\" Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. \"Finnigan, Seamus,\" the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor. \"Granger, Hermione!\" Her mione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head. \"GRYFFINDOR!\" shouted the hat. Ron groaned. A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re very nervous. What if he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better get back on the train? When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR,\" Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to \"MacDougal, Morag.\"  Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, \"SLYTHERIN!\" Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself. There weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t many people left now. \"Moon\" , \"Nott\" , \"Parkinson\" , then a pair of twin girls, \"Patil\" and \"Patil\" , then \"Perks, Sally-Anne\" , and then, at last   \"Potter, Harry!\" As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall. \"Potter, did she say?\" \"The Harry Potter?\" The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited. \"Hmm,\" said a small voice in his ear. \"Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s talent, A my goodness, yes   and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s interesting .So where shall I put you?\" Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin. \"Not Slytherin, eh?\" said the small voice. \"Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that   no? Well, if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re sure   better be GRYFFINDOR!\" Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, \"We got Potter! We got Potter!\" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water. He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell,  too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban. And now there were only three people left to be sorted. \"Thomas, Dean,\" a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. \"Turpin, Lisa,\" became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR!\" Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him. \"Well done, Ron, excellent,\" said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as \"Zabini, Blaise,\" was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away. Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago. Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there. \"Welcome,\" he said. \"Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! \"Thank you!\" He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know whether to laugh or not. \"Is he   a bit mad?\" he asked Percy uncertainly. \"Mad?\" said Percy airily. \"He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\" Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs. The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious. \"That does look good,\" said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak. \"Can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you  ?\" \"I haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t eaten for nearly five hundred years,\" said the ghost. \"I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t  need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.\" \"I know who you are!\" said Ron suddenly. \"My brothers told me about you   you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re Nearly Headless Nick!\" \"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy  \" the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted. \"Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\" Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going at all the way he wanted. \"Like this,\" he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, \"So   new Gryffindors! I hope you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s becoming almost unbearable   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the Slytherin ghost.\" Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look too pleased with the seating arrangements. \"How did he get covered in blood?\" asked Seamus with great interest. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never asked,\" said Nearly Headless Nick delicately. When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding  As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m half-and-half,\" said Seamus. \"Me dad\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a Muggle. Mom didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell him she was a witch \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.\" The others laughed. \"What about you, Neville?\" said Ron. \"Well, my gran brought me up and she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a witch,\" said Neville, \"but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me   he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned   but nothing happened until I  was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced   all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here   they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.\" On Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (\"I do hope they start right away, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s so much to learn, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s supposed to be very difficult  \"; \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing   \"). Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin. It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s turban straight into Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes   and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s forehead. \"Ouch!\" Harry clapped a hand to his head. \"What is it?\" asked Percy. \"N-nothing.\" The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s look   a feeling that he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t like Harry at all. \"Who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\" he asked Percy. \"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s looking so nervous, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to   everyone knows he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s after Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\" Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look at him again. At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent. \"Ahem   just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you. \"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\" Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.  \"I have also been asked by Mr Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. \"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch. \"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\" Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. \"He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not serious?\" he muttered to Percy. \"Must be,\" said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not allowed to go somewhere   the forest\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.\" \"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\" cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 smiles had become rather fixed. Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words. \"Everyone pick their favorite tune,\" said Dumbledore, \"and off we go!\" And the school bellowed: \"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach us something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, Our heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, So teach us things worth knowing, Bring back what we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve forgot, just do your best, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll do the rest, And learn until our brains all rot.\" Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest. \"Ah, music,\" he said, wiping his eyes. \"A magic beyond all we do here!  And now, bedtime. Off you trot!\" The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt. A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him. \"Peeves,\" Percy whispered to the first years. \"A poltergeist.\" He raised his voice, \"Peeves   show yourself.\" A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered. \"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\" There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks. \"Oooooooh!\" he said, with an evil cackle. \"Ickle Firsties! What fun!\" He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked. \"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll hear about this, I mean it!\" barked Percy. Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed. \"You want to watch out for Peeves,\" said Percy, as they set off again. \"The Bloody Baron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the only one who can control him, he won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.\" At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress. \"Password?\" she said. \"Caput Draconis,\" said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it   Neville needed a leg up   and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs. Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase   they were obviously in one of the towers   they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.  \"Great food, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. \"Get off, Scabbers! He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s chewing my sheets.\" Harry was going to ask Ron if he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once. Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully   and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it   then Malfoy turned into the hooknosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold   there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking. He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t remember the dream at all.   There, look.\" \"Where?\" \"Next to the tall kid with the red hair.\" \"Wearing the glasses?\" \"Did you see his face?\" \"Did you see his scar?\" Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes. There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk. The ghosts didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \"GOT YOUR CONK!\" Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were  rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing. Filch owned a cat called Mrs Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d whisk off for Filch, who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs Norris a good kick. And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words. They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for. Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up. Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class. \"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\" she said. \"Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.\" Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.  The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went. Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have much of a head start. Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once. \"What have we got today?\" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge. \"Double Potions with the Slytherins,\" said Ron. \"Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them   we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be able to see if it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s true.\" \"Wish McGonagall favored us,\" said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before. Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps. Hedwig hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl: Dear Harry, I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with  Hedwig. Hagrid Harry borrowed Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again. It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far. At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been wrong. Snape didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t dislike Harry   he hated him. Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls. Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name. \"Ah, Yes,\" he said softly, \"Harry Potter. Our new   celebrity.\" Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, but they had none of Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels. \"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,\" he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word   like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. \"As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses. I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death   if you aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\" More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a dunderhead. \"Potter!\" said Snape suddenly. \"What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\" Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand had shot into the air. \"I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know, sir,\" said Harry. Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lips curled into a sneer.  \"Tut, tut   fame clearly isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t everything.\" He ignored Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand. \"Let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\" Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter. \"I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know, sir.\" \"Thought you wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?\" Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi? Snape was still ignoring Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s quivering hand. \"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\" At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling. \"I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know,\" said Harry quietly. \"I think Hermione does, though, why don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you try her?\" A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased. \"Sit down,\" he snapped at Hermione. \"For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you all copying that down?\" There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, \"And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.\" Things didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class  was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs. \"Idiot boy!\" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. \"I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?\" Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose. \"Take him up to the hospital wing,\" Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville. \"You   Potter   why didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s another point you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve lost for Gryffindor.\" This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t push it,\" he muttered, \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.\" As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week   why did Snape hate him so much? \"Cheer up,\" said Ron, \"Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?\" At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door. When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice rang out, saying, \"Back, Fang   back.\" Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open. \"Hang on,\" he said. \"Back, Fang.\" He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound. There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it. \"Make yerselves at home,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked. \"This is Ron,\" Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate. \"Another Weasley, eh?\" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s freckles. I spent  half me life chasin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 yer twin brothers away from the forest.\" The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s knee and drooled all over his robes. Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch \"that old git.\" \"An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 as fer that cat, Mrs Norris, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get rid of her   Filch puts her up to it.\" Harry told Hagrid about Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students. \"But he seemed to really hate me.\" \"Rubbish!\" said Hagrid. \"Why should he?\" Yet Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help thinking that Hagrid didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t quite meet his eyes when he said that. \"How\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s yer brother Charlie?\" Hagrid asked Ron. \"I liked him a lot   great with animals.\" Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet: GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown. Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day. \"But we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s good for you,\" said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon. Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mentioned the date. \"Hagrid!\" said Harry, \"that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been happening while we were there!\" There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t meet Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves  were looking for? As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to tell Harry?   Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday   and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together. \"Typical,\" said Harry darkly. \"Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.\" He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else. \"You don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know that you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll make a fool of yourself,\" said Ron reasonably. \"Anyway, I know Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all talk.\" Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d listen about the time he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move. Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground. Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t learn by heart out of a book   not that she hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville  was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail. Harry hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t had a single letter since Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table. A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a Remembrall!\" he explained. \"Gran knows I forget things   this tells you if there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s something you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red   oh \" His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, \" you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve forgotten something .\" Neville was trying to remember what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand. Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash. \"What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going on?\" \"Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got my Remembrall, Professor.\" Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table. \"Just looking,\" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him. At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance. The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left. Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk. \"Well, what are you all waiting for?\" she barked. \"Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.\" Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck  out at odd angles. \"Stick out your right hand over your broom,\" called Madam Hooch at the front, \"and say  Up!\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\" \"UP\" everyone shouted. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground. Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been doing it wrong for years. \"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\" said Madam Hooch. \"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle   three   two  \" But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lips. \"Come back, boy!\" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle   twelve feet   twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and   WHAM   a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight. Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his. \"Broken wrist,\" Harry heard her mutter. \"Come on, boy   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all right, up you get.\" She turned to the rest of the class. \"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say  Quidditch.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Come on, dear.\" Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him. No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter. \"Did you see his face, the great lump?\" The other Slytherins joined in. \"Shut up, Malfoy,\" snapped Parvati Patil.  \"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?\" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. \"Never thought you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.\" \"Look!\" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that stupid thing Longbottom\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gran sent him.\" The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up. \"Give that here, Malfoy,\" said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch. Malfoy smiled nastily. \"I think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find   how about   up a tree?\" \"Give it here!\" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, \"Come and get it, Potter!\" Harry grabbed his broom. \"No!\" shouted Hermione Granger. \"Madam Hooch told us not to move   you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get us all into trouble.\" Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him   and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d found something he could do without being taught   this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron. He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned. \"Give it here,\" Harry called, \"or I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll knock you off that broom!\" \"Oh, yeah?\" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried. Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping. \"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\" Harry called. The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy. \"Catch it if you can, then!\" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground. Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down   next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball   wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching   he stretched out his  hand   a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist. \"HARRY POTTER!\" His heart sank faster than he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling. \"Never   in all my time at Hogwarts  \" Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, \"  how dare you   might have broken your neck  \" \"It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t his fault, Professor  \" \"Be quiet, Miss Patil  \" \"But Malfoy  \" \"That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s enough, Mr Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.\" Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d done it. He hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even lasted two weeks. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep? Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s bag. Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside. \"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?\" Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him? But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s class looking confused. \"Follow me, you two,\" said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry. \"In here.\" Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty  except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard. \"Out, Peeves!\" she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys. \"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve found you a Seeker.\" Wood\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s expression changed from puzzlement to delight. \"Are you serious, Professor?\" \"Absolutely,\" said Professor McGonagall crisply. \"The boy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a natural. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?\" Harry nodded silently. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have a clue what was going on, but he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs. \"He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,\" Professor McGonagall told Wood. \"Didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have done it.\" Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once. \"Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\" he asked excitedly. \"Wood\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s captain of the Gryffindor team,\" Professor McGonagall explained. \"He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just the build for a Seeker, too,\" said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. \"Light  speedy   we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor   a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d say.\" \"I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t bend the firstyear rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks. \" Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry. \"I want to hear you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.\" Then she suddenly smiled. \"Your father would have been proud,\" she said. \"He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.\" \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re joking.\" It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d forgotten all about it. \"Seeker?\" he said. \"But first years never   you must be the youngest house player in about  \"  \"   a century,\" said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. \"Wood told me.\" Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry. \"I start training next week,\" said Harry. \"Only don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.\" Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over. \"Well done,\" said George in a low voice. \"Wood told us. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re on the team too   Beaters.\" \"I tell you, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,\" said Fred. \"We haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t won since Charlie left, but this year\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.\" \"Anyway, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s found a new secret passageway out of the school.\" \"Bet it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.\" Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle. \"Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?\" \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re a lot braver now that you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re back on the ground and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got your little friends with you,\" said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d take you on anytime on my own,\" said Malfoy. \"Tonight, if you want. Wizard\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s duel. Wands only   no contact. What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the matter? Never heard of a wizard\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s duel before, I suppose?\" \"Of course he has,\" said Ron, wheeling around. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m his second, who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s yours?\" Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up. \"Crabbe,\" he said. \"Midnight all right? We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll meet you in the trophy room; that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s always unlocked.\" When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. \"What is a wizard\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s duel?\" said Harry. \"And what do you mean, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re my second?\" \"Well, a second\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s there to take over if you die,\" said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face, he added quickly, \"But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you  knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.\" \"And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?\" \"Throw it away and punch him on the nose,\" Ron suggested. \"Excuse me.\" They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger. \"Can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a person eat in peace in this place?\" said Ron. Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry. \"I couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying  \" \"Bet you could,\" Ron muttered. \"  and you mustn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll lose Gryffindor if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re caught, and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re bound to be. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really very selfish of you.\" \"And it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really none of your business,\" said Harry. \"Good-bye,\" said Ron. All the same, it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t what you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as \"If he tries to curse you, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better dodge it, because I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t remember how to block them.\" There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness   this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t miss it. \"Half-past eleven,\" Ron muttered at last, \"we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better go.\" They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, \"I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to do this, Harry.\" A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown. \"You!\" said Ron furiously. \"Go back to bed!\" \"I almost told your brother,\" Hermione snapped, \"Percy   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a prefect, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d put a stop to this.\" Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe anyone could be so interfering. \"Come on,\" he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady  and climbed through the hole. Hermione wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.\" \"Go away.\" \"All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re on the train home tomorrow, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re so  \" But what they were, they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower. \"Now what am I going to do?\" she asked shrilly. \"That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s your problem,\" said Ron. \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to go, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to be late.\" They hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m coming with you,\" she said. \"You are not.\" \"D\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99you think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.\" \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got some nerve  \" said Ron loudly. \"Shut up, both of you!\" said Harry sharply. I heard something.\" It was a sort of snuffling. \"Mrs Norris?\" breathed Ron, squinting through the dark. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t Mrs Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer. \"Thank goodness you found me! I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been out here for hours, I couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t remember the new password to get in to bed.\" \"Keep your voice down, Neville. The password\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s  Pig snout\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 but it won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help you now, the Fat Lady\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone off somewhere.\" \"How\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s your arm?\" said Harry. \"Fine,\" said Neville, showing them. \"Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.\" \"Good   well, look, Neville, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to be somewhere, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll see you later  \" \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t leave me!\" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, \"I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to  stay here alone, the Bloody Baron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s been past twice already.\" Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville. \"If either of you get us caught, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll never rest until I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.\" Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward. They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room. Malfoy and Crabbe weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by. \"He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s late, maybe he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s chickened out,\" Ron whispered. Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak   and it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t Malfoy. \"Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.\" It was Filch speaking to Mrs Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice. Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room. \"They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re in here somewhere,\" they heard him mutter, \"probably hiding.\" \"This way!\" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor. The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle. \"RUN!\" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following   they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going   they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.  \"I think we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve lost him,\" Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering. I   told   you,\" Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, \"I   told   you.\" \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,\" said Ron, \"quickly as possible.\" \"Malfoy tricked you,\" Hermione said to Harry. \"You realize that, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you? He was never going to meet you   Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.\" Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to tell her that. \"Let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s go.\" It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to be that simple. They hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them. It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight. \"Shut up, Peeves   please   you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get us thrown out.\" Peeves cackled. \"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get caughty.\" \"Not if you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t give us away, Peeves, please.\" \"Should tell Filch, I should,\" said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s for your own good, you know.\" \"Get out of the way,\" snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake. \"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!\" Peeves bellowed, \"STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!\" Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door   and it was locked. \"This is it!\" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re done for! This is the end!\" They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shouts. \"Oh, move over,\" Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, \"Alohomora!\" The lock clicked and the door swung open   they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening. \"Which way did they go, Peeves?\" Filch was saying. \"Quick, tell me.\" \"Say  please.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\" \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\"  \"Shan\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say nothing if you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say please,\" said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice. \"All right   please.\" \"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say nothing if you didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage. \"He thinks this door is locked,\" Harry whispered. \"I think we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be okay   get off, Neville!\" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s bathrobe for the last minute. \"What?\" Harry turned around   and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d walked into a nightmare   this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far. They weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden. They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs. It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant. Harry groped for the doorknob   between Filch and death, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d take Filch. They fell backward   Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared   all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor. \"Where on earth have you all been?\" she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces. \"Never mind that   pig snout, pig snout,\" panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs. It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never speak again. \"What do they think they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in  a school?\" said Ron finally. \"If any dog needs exercise, that one does.\" Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. \"You don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t use your eyes, any of you, do you?\" she snapped. \"Didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you see what it was standing on. \"The floor?\" Harry suggested. \"I wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.\" \"No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s obviously guarding something.\" She stood up, glaring at them. \"I hope you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed   or worse, expelled. Now, if you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mind, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to bed.\" Ron stared after her, his mouth open. \"No, we don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t mind,\" he said. \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d think we dragged her along, wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you. But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide   except perhaps Hogwarts. It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.  Malfoy couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s either really valuable or really dangerous,\" said Ron. \"Or both,\" said Harry. But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues. Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again. Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later. As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel. Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said: DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE. It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want everybody knowing you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got a broomstick or they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock for your first training session.  Professor McGonagall Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read. \"A Nimbus Two Thousand!\" Ron moaned enviously. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never even touched one.\" They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it. \"That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a broomstick,\" he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t allowed them.\" Ron couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t resist it. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not any old broomstick,\" he said, \"it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\" Ron grinned at Harry. \"Comets look flashy, but they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not in the same league as the Nimbus.\" \"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t afford half the handle,\" Malfoy snapped back. \"I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.\" Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s elbow. \"Not arguing, I hope, boys?\" he squeaked. \"Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s been sent a broomstick, Professor,\" said Malfoy quickly. \"Yes, yes, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s right,\" said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. \"Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?\" \"A Nimbus Two Thousand, it is,\" said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face. \"And it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really thanks to Malfoy here that I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got it,\" he added. Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s obvious rage and confusion. \"Well, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s true,\" Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, \"If he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stolen Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Remembrall I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be on the team.  \" \"So I suppose you think that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a reward for breaking rules?\" came an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand.  \"I thought you weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speaking to us?\" said Harry. \"Yes, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop now,\" said Ron, \"it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s doing us so much good.\" Hermione marched away with her nose in the air. Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be learning to play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last. \"Wow,\" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s bedspread. Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top. As seven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field. Held never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high. Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling   he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch. \"Hey, Potter, come down!\" Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next to him. \"Very nice,\" said Wood, his eyes glinting. \"I see what McGonagall meant you really are a natural. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be joining team practice three times a week.\" He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls. \"Right,\" said Wood. \"Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not too easy to play. There are seven players on each side. Three of them are called Chasers.\" \"Three Chasers,\" Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball. \"This ball\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s called the Quaffle,\" said Wood. \"The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops. Follow me?\" \"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\" Harry recited. \"So   that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six  hoops, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\" \"What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s basketball?\" said Wood curiously. \"Never mind,\" said Harry quickly. \"Now, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s another player on each side who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s called the Keeper   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring.\" \"Three Chasers, one Keeper,\" said Harry, who was determined to remember it all. \"And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?\" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll show you now,\" said Wood. \"Take this.\" He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to show you what the Bludgers do,\" Wood said. \"These two are the Bludgers.\" He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box. \"Stand back,\" Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers. At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air   it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground. \"See?\" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. \"The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why you have two Beaters on each team   the Weasley twins are ours   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So   think you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got all that?\" \"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\" Harry reeled off. \"Very good,\" said Wood. \"Er   have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\" Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand. \"Never at Hogwarts. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s you. And you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers  \" \"  unless they crack my head open.\" \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers   I mean, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re like a pair of human Bludgers themselves.\"  Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings. \"This,\" said Wood, \"is the Golden Snitch, and it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the most important ball of the lot. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s very hard to catch because it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s so fast and difficult to see. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the Seeker\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s job to catch it. You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages   I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep. \"Well, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s it any questions?\" Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem. \"We won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t practice with the Snitch yet,\" said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, \"it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s too dark, we might lose it. Let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s try you out with a few of these.\" He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch. Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t carry on. \"That Quidditch Cup\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have our name on it this year,\" said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. \"I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t gone off chasing dragons.\" Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d already been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics. On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d seen him make Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s toad zoom around the classroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because  Neville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t spoken to either of them since the day Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s broomstick had arrived. \"Now, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t forget that nice wrist movement we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been practicing!\" squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual. \"Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying the magic words properly is very important, too   never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said  s\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 instead of  f\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.\" It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it   Harry had to put it out with his hat. Ron, at the next table, wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t having much more luck. \"Wingardium Leviosa!\" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill. \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re saying it wrong,\" Harry heard Hermione snap. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Wing-gardium Levi-o-sa, make the  gar\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 nice and long.\" \"You do it, then, if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re so clever,\" Ron snarled. Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, \"Wingardium Leviosa!\" Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads. \"Oh, well done!\" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \"Everyone see here, Miss Granger\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s done it!\" Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no wonder no one can stand her,\" he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, \"she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a nightmare, honestly.\" Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face   and was startled to see that she was in tears. \"I think she heard you.\" \"So?\" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \"She must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve noticed she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got no friends.\" Hermione didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t turn up for the next class and wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seen all afternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 bathroom and wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween  decorations put Hermione out of their minds. A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet. Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, \"Troll   in the dungeons   thought you ought to know.\" He then sank to the floor in a dead faint. There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wand to bring silence. \"Prefects,\" he rumbled, \"lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!\" Percy was in his element. \"Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m a prefect!\" \"How could a troll get in?\" Harry asked as they climbed the stairs. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ask me, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re supposed to be really stupid,\" said Ron. \"Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.\" They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arm. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve just thought   Hermione.\" \"What about her?\" \"She doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know about the troll.\" Ron bit his lip. \"Oh, all right,\" he snapped. \"But Percy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better not see us.\" Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them. \"Percy!\" hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin. Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view. \"What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s he doing?\" Harry whispered. \"Why isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?\" \"Search me.\" Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s  fading footsteps. \"He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heading for the third floor,\" Harry said, but Ron held up his hand. \"Can you smell something?\" Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean. And then they heard it   a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed   at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long. The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room. \"The keys in the lock,\" Harry muttered. \"We could lock it in.\" \"Good idea,\" said Ron nervously. They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it. \"Yes!\" Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop   a high, petrified scream   and it was coming from the chamber they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just chained up. \"Oh, no,\" said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the girls\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 bathroom!\" Harry gasped. \"Hermione!\" they said together. It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside. Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went. \"Confuse it!\" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall. The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It  hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went. \"Oy, pea-brain!\" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it. \"Come on, run, run!\" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror. The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape. Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s neck from behind. The troll couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wand had still been in his hand when he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d jumped \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 it had gone straight up one of the troll\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nostrils. Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club. Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand   not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: \"Wingardium Leviosa!\" The club flew suddenly out of the troll\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over   and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head. The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble. Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done. It was Hermione who spoke first. \"Is it   dead?\" \"I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think so,\" said Harry, I think it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just been knocked out.\" He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue. \"Urgh   troll boogers.\" He wiped it on the troll\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s trousers. A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll,  let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart. Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mind. \"What on earth were you thinking of?\" said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air. \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re lucky you weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t killed. Why aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you in your dormitory?\" Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down. Then a small voice came out of the shadows. \"Please, Professor McGonagall   they were looking for me.\" \"Miss Granger!\" Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last. \"I went looking for the troll because I   I thought I could deal with it on my own   you know, because I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve read all about them.\" Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher? \"If they hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t found me, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.\" Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t new to them. \"Well   in that case ...\" said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, \"Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?\" Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets. \"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m very disappointed in you. If you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not hurt at all, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better get off to Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing the feast in their houses.\" Hermione left. Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron. \"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go.\" They hurried out of the chamber and didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak at all until they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite  apart from anything else. \"We should have gotten more than ten points,\" Ron grumbled. \"Five, you mean, once she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s taken off Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s.\" \"Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,\" Ron admitted. \"Mind you, we did save her.\" \"She might not have needed saving if we hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t locked the thing in with her,\" Harry reminded him. They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady. \"Pig snout,\" they said and entered. The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said \"Thanks,\" and hurried off to get plates. But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.   A s they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots. The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship. Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know which was worse   people telling him he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be brilliant or people telling him they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be running around underneath him holding a mattress. It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know how he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read. Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert. Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be allowed. Unfortunately,  something about their guilty faces caught Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eye. He limped over. He hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway. \"What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got there, Potter?\" It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him. \"Library books are not to be taken outside the school,\" said Snape. \"Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.\" \"He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just made that rule up,\" Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. \"Wonder what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wrong with his leg?\" \"Dunno, but I hope it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really hurting him,\" said Ron bitterly. The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (\"How will you learn?\"), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway. Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it. \"Better you than me,\" they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t refuse if there were other teachers listening. He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing. Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered inside \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 and a horrible scene met his eyes. Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages. \"Blasted thing,\" Snape was saying. \"How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?\" Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but   \"POTTER!\" Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped. \"I just wondered if I could have my book back.\" \"GET OUT! OUT!\" Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs.  \"Did you get it?\" Ron asked as Harry joined them. \"What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the matter?\" In a low whisper, Harry told them what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d seen. \"You know what this means?\" he finished breathlessly. \"He tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s where he was going when we saw him   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s after whatever it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guarding! And I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!\" Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes were wide. \"No   he wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, she said. \"I know he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not very nice, but he wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.\" \"Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,\" snapped Ron. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m with Harry. I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t put anything past Snape. But what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s he after? What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that dog guarding?\" Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sleep. He tried to empty his mind   he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 but the expression on Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t easy to forget. The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match. \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to eat some breakfast.\" \"I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want anything.\" \"Just a bit of toast,\" wheedled Hermione. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not hungry.\" Harry felt terrible. In an hour\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s time he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be walking onto the field. \"Harry, you need your strength,\" said Seamus Finnigan. \"Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.\" \"Thanks, Seamus,\" said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages. By eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes. Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different  colors. Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green). Wood cleared his throat for silence. \"Okay, men,\" he said. \"And women,\" said Chaser Angelina Johnson. \"And women,\" Wood agreed. \"This is it.\" \"The big one,\" said Fred Weasley. \"The one we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve all been waiting for,\" said George. \"We know Oliver\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s speech by heart,\" Fred told Harry, \"we were on the team last year.\" \"Shut up, you two,\" said Wood. \"This is the best team Gryffindor\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s had in years. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to win. I know it.\" He glared at them all as if to say, \"Or else.\" \"Right. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s time. Good luck, all of you.\" Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers. Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand. \"Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,\" she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver. \"Mount your brooms, please.\" Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand. Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle. Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off. \"And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor   what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too  \" \"JORDAN!\" \"Sorry, Professor.\" The Weasley twins\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall. \"And she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, last year only a reserve   back to Johnson and   no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains  the Quaffle and off he goes   Flint flying like an eagle up there   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to sc  no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle   that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and   OUCH   that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger   Quaffle taken by the Slytherins   that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s blocked by a second Bludger   sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell which   nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes   she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really flying   dodges a speeding Bludger   the goal posts are ahead   come on, now, Angelina   Keeper Bletchley dives   misses   GRYFFINDORS SCORE!\" Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins. \"Budge up there, move along.\" \"Hagrid!\" Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them. \"Bin watchin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 from me hut,\" said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, \"But it isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t the same as bein\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?\" \"Nope,\" said Ron. \"Harry hasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t had much to do yet.\" \"Kept outta trouble, though, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s somethin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99,\" said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry. Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s game plan. \"Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,\" Wood had said. \"We don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want you attacked before you have to be.\" When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it. \"All right there, Harry?\" he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint. \"Slytherin in possession,\" Lee Jordan was saying, \"Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the   wait a moment   was that the Snitch?\" A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle,  too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear. Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch   all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch. Harry was faster than Higgs   he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead   he put on an extra spurt of speed   WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below   Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life. \"Foul!\" screamed the Gryffindors. Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again. Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, \"Send him off, ref! Red card!\" \"What are you talking about, Dean?\" said Ron. \"Red card!\" said Dean furiously. \"In soccer you get shown the red card and you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re out of the game!\" \"But this isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t soccer, Dean,\" Ron reminded him. Hagrid, however, was on Dean\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s side. \"They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.\" Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides. \"So   after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating  \" \"Jordan!\" growled Professor McGonagall. \"I mean, after that open and revolting foul \" \"Jordan, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m warning you  \" \"All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.\" It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never felt anything like that. It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal-posts   he had half a mind  to ask Wood to call time-out   and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t turn it. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him. Lee was still commentating. \"Slytherin in possession   Flint with the Quaffle   passes Spinnet   passes Bell   hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose   only joking, Professor   Slytherins score   A no \" The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went. \"Dunno what Harry thinks he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s doing,\" Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. \"If I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 know better, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d say he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d lost control of his broom but he can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have. \" Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand. \"Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?\" Seamus whispered. \"Can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have,\" Hagrid said, his voice shaking. \"Can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic   no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.\" At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd. \"What are you doing?\" moaned Ron, gray-faced. \"I knew it,\" Hermione gasped, \"Snape   look.\" Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath. \"He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s doing something   jinxing the broom,\" said Hermione. \"What should we do?\" \"Leave it to me.\" Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him,  obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing. \"Come on, Hermione,\" Ron muttered desperately. Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s robes. It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row   Snape would never know what had happened. It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom. \"Neville, you can look!\" Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s jacket for the last five minutes. Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick   he hit the field on all fours   coughed   and something gold fell into his hand. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got the Snitch!\" he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion. \"He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,\" Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference   Harry hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results   Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hut, with Ron and Hermione. \"It was Snape,\" Ron was explaining, \"Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t take his eyes off you.\" \"Rubbish,\" said Hagrid, who hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. \"Why would Snape do somethin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 like that?\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth. \"I found out something about him,\" he told Hagrid. \"He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guarding.\" Hagrid dropped the teapot. \"How do you know about Fluffy?\" he said. \"Fluffy?\"  \"Yeah   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mine   bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 year   I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the  \" \"Yes?\" said Harry eagerly. \"Now, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ask me anymore,\" said Hagrid gruffly. \"That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s top secret, that is.\" \"But Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s trying to steal it.\" \"Rubbish,\" said Hagrid again. \"Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a Hogwarts teacher, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d do nothin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 of the sort.\" \"So why did he just try and kill Harry?\" cried Hermione. The afternoon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape. \"I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve read all about them! You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blinking at all, I saw him!\" \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m tellin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 yeh, yer wrong!\" said Hagrid hotly. \"I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 know why Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 try an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh   yer meddlin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 in things that don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 concern yeh. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dangerous. You forget that dog, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you forget what it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guardin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s between Professor Dumbledore an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Nicolas Flamel  \" \"Aha!\" said Harry, \"so there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?\" Hagrid looked furious with himself.   C hristmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again. No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons. \"I do feel so sorry,\" said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, \"for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not wanted at home.\" He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a widemouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family. It was true that Harry wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr and Mrs Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie. When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it. \"Hi, Hagrid, want any help?\" Ron asked, sticking his head through the  branches. \"Nah, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m all right, thanks, Ron.\" \"Would you mind moving out of the way?\" came Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cold drawl from behind them. \"Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose   that hut of Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s must seem like a palace compared to what your family\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s used to.\" Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs. \"WEASLEY!\" Ron let go of the front of Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s robes. \"He was provoked, Professor Snape,\" said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. \"Malfoy was insultin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 his family.\" \"Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,\" said Snape silkily. \"Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t more. Move along, all of you.\" Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get him,\" said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s back, \"one of these days, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get him  \" \"I hate them both,\" said Harry, \"Malfoy and Snape.\" \"Come on, cheer up, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nearly Christmas,\" said Hagrid. \"Tell yeh what, come with me an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 see the Great Hall, looks a treat.\" So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations. \"Ah, Hagrid, the last tree   put it in the far corner, would you?\" The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles. \"How many days you got left until yer holidays?\" Hagrid asked. \"Just one,\" said Hermione. \"And that reminds me   Harry, Ron, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.\" \"Oh yeah, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re right,\" said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree. \"The library?\" said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. \"Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t yeh?\" \"Oh, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not working,\" Harry told him brightly. \"Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been trying to find out who he is.\"  \"You what?\" Hagrid looked shocked. \"Listen here   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve told yeh   drop it. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 to you what that dog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guardin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99.\" \"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all,\" said Hermione. \"Unless you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like to tell us and save us the trouble?\" Harry added. \"We must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been through hundreds of books already and we can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t find him anywhere   just give us a hint   I know I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve read his name somewhere.\" \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sayin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 nothin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, said Hagrid flatly. \"Just have to find out for ourselves, then,\" said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library. They had indeed been searching books for Flamel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows. Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts. \"What are you looking for, boy?\" \"Nothing,\" said Harry. Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him. \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better get out, then. Go on   out!\" Wishing he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be able to tell them, but they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t risk Snape hearing what they were up to. Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t surprising they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.  Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch. \"You will keep looking while I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m away, won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you?\" said Hermione. \"And send me an owl if you find anything.\" \"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\" said Ron. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be safe to ask them.\" \"Very safe, as they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re both dentists,\" said Hermione. Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork   bread, English muffins, marshmallows   and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t work. Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family   in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted. Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t trust him at all. He wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t send me there, can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.\" On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed. \"Merry Christmas,\" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe. \"You, too,\" said Harry. \"Will you look at this? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got some presents!\" \"What did you expect, turnips?\" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it   it sounded a bit like an owl. A second, very small parcel contained a note.  We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece. \"That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s friendly,\" said Harry. Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence. \"Weird!\" he said,  What a shape! This is money?\" \"You can keep it,\" said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. \"Hagrid and my aunt and uncle   so who sent these?\" \"I think I know who that one\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s from,\" said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. \"My mom. I told her you didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t expect any presents and   oh, no,\" he groaned, \"she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s made you a Weasley sweater.\" Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge. \"Every year she makes us a sweater,\" said Ron, unwrapping his own, \"and mine\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s always maroon.\" \"That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s really nice of her,\" said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty. His next present also contained candy   a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione. This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it. Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve heard of those,\" he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d gotten from Hermione. \"If that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what I think it is   they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re really rare, and really valuable.\" \"What is it?\" Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s an invisibility cloak,\" said Ron, a look of awe on his face. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sure it is   try it on.\" Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell. \"It is! Look down!\" Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely. \"There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a note!\" said Ron suddenly. \"A note fell out of it!\" Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words:  Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well. A Very Merry Christmas to you. There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d give anything for one of these,\" he said. \"Anything. What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the matter?\" \"Nothing,\" said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father? Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet. \"Merry Christmas!\" \"Hey, look   Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got a Weasley sweater, too!\" Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G. \"Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s is better than ours, though,\" said Fred, holding up Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sweater. \"She obviously makes more of an effort if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not family.\" \"Why aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you wearing yours, Ron?\" George demanded. \"Come on, get it on, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re lovely and warm.\" \"I hate maroon,\" Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head. \"You haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got a letter on yours,\" George observed. \"I suppose she thinks you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t forget your name. But we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not stupid   we know we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re called Gred and Forge.\" \"What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all this noise?\" Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized. \"P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re all wearing ours, even Harry got one.\" \"I   don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t   want  \" said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew. \"And you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not sitting with the prefects today, either,\" said George. \"Christmas is a time for family.\" They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.  Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him. Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided. When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs Norris\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Christmas dinner. Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have lost so badly if Percy hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tried to help him so much. After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d stolen his prefect badge. It had been Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it. Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it. His father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s this had been his father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.  He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling. Use it well. Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know. Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back   his father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cloak   he felt that this time   the first time   he wanted to use it alone. He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole. \"Who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s there?\" squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor. Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked. The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps. The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles. They didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be. He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open. A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence   the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp,  which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside   stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shrieks still ringing in his ears. He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there. \"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s been in the library Restricted Section.\" Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, \"The Restricted Section? Well, they can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be far, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll catch them.\" Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d knock right into him   the cloak didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop him from being solid. He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in. It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way. It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it. He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He  whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed   for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him. But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror. There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder   but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not? He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 she and the others existed only in the mirror. She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes   her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green   exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s did. Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection. \"Mom?\" he whispered. \"Dad?\" They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s knobbly knees   Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life. The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. How long he stood there, he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face, whispered, \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll come back,\" and hurried from the room. \"You could have woken me up,\" said Ron, crossly. \"You can come tonight, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going back, I want to show you the mirror. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like to see your mom and dad,\" Ron said eagerly.  \"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.\" \"You can see them any old time,\" said Ron. \"Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you eating anything?\" Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really? \"Are you all right?\" said Ron. \"You look odd.\" What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m freezing,\" said Ron. \"Let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s forget it and go back.\" \"No!\" Harry hissed. I know it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s here somewhere.\" They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s here   just here   yes!\" They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror. There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him. \"See?\" Harry whispered. \"I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see anything.\" \"Look! Look at them all there are loads of them. \" \"I can only see you.\" \"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\" Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas. Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image. \"Look at me!\" he said. \"Can you see all your family standing around you?\" \"No   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m alone   but I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m different   I look older   and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m head boy!\" \"What?\" \"I am   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m wearing the badge like Bill used to   and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m holding the  house cup and the Quidditch cup   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m Quidditch captain, too.\" Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry. \"Do you think this mirror shows the future?\" \"How can it? All my family are dead   let me have another look  \" \"You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.\" \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re only holding the Quidditch cup, what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s interesting about that? I want to see my parents.\" \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t push me  \" A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. They hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t realized how loudly they had been talking. \"Quick!\" Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing   did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left. \"This isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t safe   she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on.\" And Ron pulled Harry out of the room. The snow still hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t melted the next morning. \"Want to play chess, Harry?\" said Ron. \"No.\" \"Why don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t we go down and visit Hagrid?\" \"No you go \" \"I know what you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go back tonight.\" \"Why not?\" \"I dunno, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve just got a bad feeling about it   and anyway, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs Norris are wandering around. So what if they can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?\" \"You sound like Hermione.\" \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m serious, Harry, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go.\" But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t going to stop him. That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t meet  anyone. And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all. Except   \"So   back again, Harry?\" Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t noticed him. \"I   I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see you, sir.\" \"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\" said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling. \"So,\" said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, \"you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.\" \"I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know it was called that, Sir.\" \"But I expect you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve realized by now what it does?\" \"It   well   it shows me my family  \" \"And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.\" \"How did you know  ?\" \"I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t need a cloak to become invisible,\" said Dumbledore gently. \"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\" Harry shook his head. \"Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?\" Harry thought. Then he said slowly, \"It shows us what we want  whatever we want \" \"Yes and no,\" said Dumbledore quietly. \"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible. \"The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be  prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?\" Harry stood up. \"Sir   Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?\" \"Obviously, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve just done so,\" Dumbledore smiled. \"You may ask me one more thing, however.\" \"What do you see when you look in the mirror?\" \"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.\" Harry stared. \"One can never have enough socks,\" said Dumbledore. \"Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.\" It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.  Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter. \"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\" said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams. Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\"If Filch had caught you!\"), and disappointment that he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was. They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again. Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training. Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms. \"Will you stop messing around!\" he yelled. \"That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s exactly the sort of thing that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll lose us the match! Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s refereeing this time, and he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\" George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words. \"Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s refereeing?\" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. \"When\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not going to be fair if we might  overtake Slytherin.\" The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not my fault,\" said Wood. \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got an excuse to pick on us.\" Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch.  The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t talk to me for a moment,\" said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, \"I need to concen \" He caught sight of Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face. \"What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the matter with you? You look terrible.\" Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t play,\" said Hermione at once. \"Say you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re ill,\" said Ron. \"Pretend to break your leg,\" Hermione suggested. \"Really break your leg,\" said Ron. \"I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t,\" said Harry. \"There isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t play at all.\" At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower. Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. \"What happened?\" Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron. \"Malfoy,\" said Neville shakily. \"I met him outside the library. He said he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been looking for someone to practice that on.\" \"Go to Professor McGonagall!\" Hermione urged Neville. \"Report him!\" Neville shook his head. \"I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want more trouble,\" he mumbled. \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to stand up to him, Neville!\" said Ron. \"He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s used to walking all over people, but that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.\" \"There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no need to tell me I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s already done that,\" Neville choked out.  Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry. \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re worth twelve of Malfoy,\" Harry said. \"The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it? And where\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.\" Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog. \"Thanks, Harry I think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll go to bed. D\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99you want the card, you collect them, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you?\" As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card. \"Dumbledore again,\" he said, \"He was the first one I ever  \" He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve found him!\" he whispered. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve found Flamel! I told you I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here   listen to this:  Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99!\" Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t looked so excited since they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework. \"Stay there!\" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms. \"I never thought to look in here!\" she whispered excitedly. \"I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\" \"Light?\" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself. At last she found what she was looking for. \"I knew it! I knew it!\" \"Are we allowed to speak yet?\" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him. \"Nicolas Flamel,\" she whispered dramatically, \"is the only known maker of the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone!\" This didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have quite the effect she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d expected. \"The what?\" said Harry and Ron. \"Oh, honestly, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you two read? Look \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 read that, there.\" She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone,  a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal. There have been many reports of the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixtyfifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight). \"See?\" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. \"The dog must be guarding Flamel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re friends and he knew someone was after it, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!\" \"A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!\" said Harry. \"No wonder Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s after it! Anyone would want it.\" \"And no wonder we couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,\" said Ron. \"He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not exactly recent if he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s six hundred and sixty-five, is he?\" The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d do with a Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone if they had one. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t until Ron said he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to play,\" he told Ron and Hermione. \"If I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, all the Slytherins will think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m just too scared to face Snape. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll show them it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.\" \"Just as long as we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not wiping you off the field,\" said Hermione. As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee? Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d found out about the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone? Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t  see how he could   yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds. Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d ever see him alive again. This wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t what you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand. Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry. \"Now, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t forget, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Locomotor Mortis,\" Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve. \"I know,\" Ron snapped. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t nag.\" Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.\" \"The whole school\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s out there!\" said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. \"Even   blimey   Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s come to watch!\" Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heart did a somersault. \"Dumbledore?\" he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard. Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching. Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never seen Snape look so mean,\" he told Hermione. \"Look   they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re off. Ouch!\" Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy. \"Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see you there.\" Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle. \"Wonder how long Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?\" Ron didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because  George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch. \"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?\" said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s people they feel sorry for. See, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Potter, who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got no parents, then there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the Weasleys, who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got no money   you should be on the team, Longbottom, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got no brains.\" Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,\" he stammered. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, \"You tell him, Neville.\" \"Longbottom, if brains were gold you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be poorer than Weasley, and that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s saying something.\" Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m warning you, Malfoy   one more word \" \"Ron!\" said Hermione suddenly, \"Harry  \" \"What? Where?\" Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet. \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re in luck, Weasley, Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s obviously spotted some money on the ground!\" said Malfoy. Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help. \"Come on, Harry!\" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape   she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle. Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches   the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand. The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly. \"Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s over! Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s won! We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!\" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat  and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front. Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t believe it. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d done it   the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped   then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s smiling face. \"Well done,\" said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear. \"Nice to see you haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been brooding about that mirror...been keeping busy...excellent...\" Snape spat bitterly on the ground. Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ever remember feeling happier. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d really done something to be proud of now \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed. Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d done it, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d shown Snape .... And speaking of Snape  A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner   what was going on? Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed. The trees were so thick he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see where Snape had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree. He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves. Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying. \" d-don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus \"  \"Oh, I thought we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d keep this private,\" said Snape, his voice icy. \"Students aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t supposed to know about the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone, after all.\" Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted him. \"Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s yet?\" \"B-b-but Severus, I  \" \"You don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\" said Snape, taking a step toward him. \"I-I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what you \" \"You know perfectly well what I mean.\" An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, \"  your little bit of hocus-pocus. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m waiting.\" \"B-but I d-d-don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t  \" \"Very well,\" Snape cut in. \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have another little chat soon, when you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.\" He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified. \"Harry, where have you been?\" Hermione squeaked. \"We won! You won! We won!\" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. \"And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be all right   talk about showing Slytherin! I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve waiting for you in the common room, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.\" \"Never mind that now,\" said Harry breathlessly. \"Let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s find an empty room, you wait \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99til you hear this....\" He made sure Peeves wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d seen and heard. \"So we were right, it is the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone, and Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy   and he said something about Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s  hocus pocus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99   I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through  \" \"So you mean the Stone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?\" said Hermione in alarm.  \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be gone by next Tuesday,\" said Ron.  Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look as though he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d cracked yet. Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s stutter. Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same. \"Hermione, the exams are ages away.\" \"Ten weeks,\" Hermione snapped. \"That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not ages, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.\" \"But we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not six hundred years old,\" Ron reminded her. \"Anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s an A.\" \"What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gotten into me. \" Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll never remember this,\" Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really fine day they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had in months. The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming. Harry, who was looking up \"Dittany\" in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look up until he heard Ron say, \"Hagrid! What are you doing  in the library?\" Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat. \"Jus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 lookin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99,\" he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once. \"An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re you lot up ter?\" He looked suddenly suspicious. \"Yer not still lookin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?\" \"Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,\" said Ron impressively. \"And we know what that dog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guarding, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s St \" \"Shhhh!\" Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 go shoutin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 about it, what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the matter with yeh?\" \"There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,\" said Harry, \"about what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy  \" \"SHHHH!\" said Hagrid again. \"Listen   come an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 see me later, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not promisin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll tell yeh anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, mind, but don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 go rabbitin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 about it in here, students aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99pposed ter know. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve told yeh  \" \"See you later, then,\" said Harry. Hagrid shuffled off. \"What was he hiding behind his back?\" said Hermione thoughtfully. \"Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?\" \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to see what section he was in,\" said Ron, who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table. \"Dragons!\" he whispered. \"Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Guide.\" \"Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him, \" said Harry. \"But it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s against our laws,\" said Ron. \"Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re keeping dragons in the back garden   anyway, you can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tame dragons, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got off wild ones in Romania.\" \"But there aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t wild dragons in Britain?\" said Harry. \"Of course there are,\" said Ron. \"Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve spotted them, to make them forget.\" \"So what on earth\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Hagrid up to?\" said Hermione.  When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called \"Who is it?\" before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them. It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused. \"So   yeh wanted to ask me somethin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. \"We were wondering if you could tell us what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s guarding the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone apart from Fluffy.\" Hagrid frowned at him. \"O\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 course I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t,\" he said. \"Number one, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 tell yeh if I could. That Stone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts   I s\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ppose yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve worked that out an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 all? Beats me how yeh even know abou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Fluffy.\" \"Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,\" said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. \"We only wondered who had done the guarding, really.\" Hermione went on. \"We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.\" Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione. \"Well, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 s\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s see he borrowed Fluffy from me then some o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the teachers did enchantments  Professor Sprout   Professor Flitwick   Professor McGonagall  \" he ticked them off on his fingers, \"Professor Quirrell   an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Dumbledore himself did somethin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 course. Hang on, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.\" \"Snape?\" \"Yeah   yer not still on abou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not about ter steal it.\" Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything   except, it seemed, Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s spell and how to get past Fluffy. \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you, Hagrid?\" said Harry anxiously. \"And you wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell anyone, would you? Not even one of the teachers?\" \"Not a soul knows except me an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid proudly.  \"Well, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s something,\" Harry muttered to the others. \"Hagrid, can we have a window open? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m boiling.\" \"Can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, Harry, sorry,\" said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too. \"Hagrid   what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that?\" But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg. \"Ah,\" said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, \"That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s   er \" \"Where did you get it, Hagrid?\" said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. \"It must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve cost you a fortune.\" \"Won it,\" said Hagrid. \"Las\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 night. I was down in the village havin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 a few drinks an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 got into a game o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.\" \"But what are you going to do with it when it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hatched?\" said Hermione. \"Well, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve bin doin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 some readin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99,\" said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow. \"Got this outta the library   Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a bit outta date, o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 course, but it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all in here. Keep the egg in the fire,  cause their mothers breathe on I em, see, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 see here   how ter recognize diff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99rent eggs   what I got there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a Norwegian Ridgeback. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re rare, them.\" He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. \"Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,\" she said. But Hagrid wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire. So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut. \"Wonder what it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s like to have a peaceful life,\" Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts. Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid. He had written only two words: It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hatching. Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t hear of it. \"Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?\" \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got lessons, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get into trouble, and that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothing to what  Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to be in when someone finds out what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s doing \" \"Shut up!\" Harry whispered. Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t like the look on Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face at all. Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nearly out.\" He ushered them inside. The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it. They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath. All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes. It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout. \"Isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he beautiful?\" Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs. \"Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!\" said Hagrid. \"Hagrid,\" said Hermione, \"how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?\" Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face   he leapt to his feet and ran to the window. \"What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the matter?\" \"Someone was lookin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 through the gap in the curtains   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a kid   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s runnin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 back up ter the school.\" Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no mistaking him. Malfoy had seen the dragon. Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their free time in Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s darkened hut, trying to reason with him. \"Just let him go,\" Harry urged. \"Set him free.\" \"I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t,\" said Hagrid. \"He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s too little. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d die.\" They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a  week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve decided to call him Norbert,\" said Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes. \"He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Mommy?\" \"He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lost his marbles,\" Ron muttered in Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ear. \"Hagrid,\" said Harry loudly, \"give it two weeks and Norbert\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.\" Hagrid bit his lip. \"I   I know I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t keep him forever, but I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t jus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 dump him, I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t.\" Harry suddenly turned to Ron. \"Charlie.\" he said. \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re losing it, too,\" said Ron. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m Ron, remember?\" \"No   Charlie   your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!\" \"Brilliant!\" said Ron. \"How about it, Hagrid?\" And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to ask him. The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s invisibility cloak. He had been down at Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate. \"It bit me!\" he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the most horrible animal I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.\" There was a tap on the dark window. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Hedwig!\" said Harry, hurrying to let her in. \"She\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have Charlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s answer!\" The three of them put their heads together to read the note. Dear Ron, How are you? Thanks for the letter   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be glad to take the Norwegian  Ridgeback, but it won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be seen carrying an illegal dragon. Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s still dark. Send me an answer as soon as possible. Love, Charlie They looked at one another. \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got the invisibility cloak,\" said Harry. \"It shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be too difficult \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.\" It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert   and Malfoy. There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey   would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s fangs were poisonous. Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not just my hand,\" he whispered, \"although that feels like it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve told her it was a dog, but I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think she believes me   I shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s doing this.\" Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\" said Hermione, but this didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat. \"Midnight on Saturday!\" he said in a hoarse voice. \"Oh no oh no   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve just remembered   Charlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to know we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re getting rid of Norbert.\" Harry and Hermione didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s too late to change the plan now,\" Harry told Hermione. \"We haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of  Norbert. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have to risk it. And we have got the invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know about that.\" They found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them. \"I won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t let you in,\" he puffed. \"Norbert\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s at a tricky stage   nothin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t handle.\" When they told him about Charlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg. \"Aargh! It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all right, he only got my boot   jus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 playin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s only a baby, after all.\" The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t come quickly enough. They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hut because they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate. \"He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got lots o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 rats an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 some brandy fer the journey,\" said Hagrid in a muffled voice. \"An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.\" From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off. \"Bye-bye, Norbert!\" Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. \"Mommy will never forget you!\" How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. UP another staircase, then another \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 even one of Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shortcuts didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make the work much easier. \"Nearly there!\" Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower. Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared. Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.  \"Detention!\" she shouted. \"And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you  \" \"You don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t understand, Professor. Harry Potter\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coming   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got a dragon!\" \"What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on   I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!\" The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig. \"Malfoy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got detention! I could sing!\" \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t,\" Harry advised her. Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness. Charlie\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much. At last, Norbert was going going gone. They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon   Malfoy in detention   what could spoil their happiness? The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness. \"Well, well, well,\" he whispered, \"we are in trouble.\" They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower.  Things couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have been worse. Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased each other around Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the invisibility cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already. Had Harry thought that things couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville. \"Harry!\" Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. \"I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag \" Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them. \"I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s one o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.\" It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue. \"I think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got a good idea of what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s been going on,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"It doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve already caught him. I suppose you think it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?\" Harry caught Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Neville   Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them.  \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m disgusted,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Four students out of bed in one night! I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions   yes, you too, Mr Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s very dangerous   and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.\" \"Fifty?\" Harry gasped   they would lose the lead, the lead he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d won in the last Quidditch match. \"Fifty points each,\" said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose. \"Professor   please  \" \"You can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t  \" \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t tell me what I can and can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.\" A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one night, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this? Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d done? At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been a mistake. How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years. From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, \"Thanks Potter, we owe you one!\" Only Ron stood by him. \"They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been here, and people still like them.\"  \"They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?\" said Harry miserably. \"Well   no,\" Ron admitted. It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t his business from now on. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team. \"Resign?\" Wood thundered. \"What good\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t win at Quidditch?\" But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him \"the Seeker.\" Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t as well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence. Harry was almost glad that the exams weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions.... Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice. \"No   no   not again, please  \" It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer. \"All right   all right  \" he heard Quirrell sob. Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d promised himself about not meddling. All the same, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have gambled twelve Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step   Quirrell seemed to have given in at last. Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on  Astronomy. Harry told them what he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d heard. \"Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s done it, then!\" said Ron. \"If Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell  \" \"There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s still Fluffy, though,\" said Hermione. \"Maybe Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,\" said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. \"I bet there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?\" The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could. \"Go to Dumbledore. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be thrown out for sure.\" \"But we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got no proof!\" said Harry. \"Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s too scared to back us up. Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s only got to say he doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor   who do you think they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll believe, him or us? It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help us if his life depended on it, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll think. And don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t forget, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll take a lot of explaining.\" Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. \"If we just do a bit of poking around  \" \"No,\" said Harry flatly, \"we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve done enough poking around.\" He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons. The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same: Your detention will take place at eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock tonight. Meet Mr Filch in the entrance hall. Professor McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d got. At eleven o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there    and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too. \"Follow me,\" said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside. \"I bet you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you, eh?\" he said, leering at them. \"Oh yes hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me .It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just a pity they let the old punishments die out hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got the chains still in my office, keep  em well oiled in case they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re ever needed Right, off we go, and don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think of running off, now, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be worse for you if you do.\" They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be sounding so delighted. The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hut. Then they heard a distant shout. \"Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.\" Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because Filch said, \"I suppose you think you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s into the forest you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m much mistaken if you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll all come out in one piece.\" At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks. \"The forest?\" he repeated, and he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sound quite as cool as usual. \"We can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go in there at night   there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all sorts of things in there   werewolves, I heard.\" Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s robe and made a choking noise. \"That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s your problem, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\" said Filch, his voice cracking with glee. \"Should\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you?\" Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder. \"Abou\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 time,\" he said. \"I bin waitin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fer half an hour already. All right, Harry, Hermione?\" \"I shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,\" said Filch coldly, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re here to be punished, after all.\" \"That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s why yer late, is it?\" said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. \"Bin lecturin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 them, eh?  Snot your place ter do that. Yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve done yer bit, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll take over from here.\"  \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be back at dawn,\" said Filch, \"for what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s left of them,\" he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness. Malfoy now turned to Hagrid. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not going in that forest,\" he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice. \"Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,\" said Hagrid fiercely. \"Yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve done wrong an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 now yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got ter pay fer it.\" \"But this is servant stuff, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not for students to do. I thought we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d \" \" tell yer that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s how it is at Hogwarts,\" Hagrid growled. \"Copyin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 lines! What good\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that ter anyone? Yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll do summat useful or yeh\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get out. If yeh think yer father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 pack. Go on.\" Malfoy didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze. \"Right then,\" said Hagrid, \"now, listen carefully,  cause it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dangerous what we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re gonna do tonight, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 want no one takin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 risks. Follow me over here a moment.\" He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest. \"Look there,\" said Hagrid, \"see that stuff shinin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 on the ground? Silvery stuff? That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s unicorn blood. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re gonna try an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.\" \"And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?\" said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice. \"There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nothin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 that lives in the forest that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,\" said Hagrid. \"An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 keep ter the path. Right, now, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re gonna split inter two parties an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 follow the trail in diff\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99rent directions. There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s blood all over the place, it must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve bin staggerin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 around since last night at least.\" \"I want Fang,\" said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s long teeth. \"All right, but I warn yeh, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a coward,\" said Hagrid. \"So me, Harry, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll go one way an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Draco, Neville, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Fang\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 practice now   that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s it   an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll all come an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 find yeh   so, be careful   let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s go.\" The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in  the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right. They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves. Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried. \"Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?\" Harry asked. \"Not fast enough,\" said Hagrid. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.\" They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path. \"You all right, Hermione?\" Hagrid whispered. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 worry, it can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve gone far if it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s this badly hurt, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 then we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be able ter   GET BEHIND THAT TREE!\" Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away. \"I knew it,\" he murmured. \"There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s summat in here that shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 be.\" \"A werewolf?\" Harry suggested. \"That wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 no werewolf an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 no unicorn, neither,\" said Hagrid grimly. \"Right, follow me, but careful, now.\" They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved. \"Who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s there?\" Hagrid called. \"Show yerself   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m armed!\" And into the clearing came   was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s jaws dropped. \"Oh, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s you, Ronan,\" said Hagrid in relief. \"How are yeh?\" He walked forward and shook the centaur\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand. \"Good evening to you, Hagrid,\" said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful voice. \"Were you going to shoot me?\" \"Can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be too careful, Ronan,\" said Hagrid, patting his crossbow. \"There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 this is Ronan, you two. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a centaur. \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d noticed,\" said Hermione faintly.  \"Good evening,\" said Ronan. \"Students, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?\" \"Erm  \" \"A bit,\" said Hermione timidly. \"A bit. Well, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s something.\" Ronan sighed. He flung back his head and stared at the sky. \"Mars is bright tonight.\" \"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, glancing up, too. \"Listen, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m glad we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve run inter yeh, Ronan,  cause there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a unicorn bin hurt   you seen anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99?\" Ronan didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again. \"Always the innocent are the first victims,\" he said. \"So it has been for ages past, so it is now.\" \"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, \"but have yeh seen anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Ronan? Anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 unusual?\" \"Mars is bright tonight,\" Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. \"Unusually bright.\" \"Yeah, but I was meanin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 unusual a bit nearer home, said Hagrid. \"So yeh haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t noticed anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 strange?\" Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, \"The forest hides many secrets.\" A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan. \"Hullo, Bane,\" said Hagrid. \"All right?\" \"Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\" \"Well enough. Look, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve jus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 bin askin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Ronan, you seen anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 odd in here lately? There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a unicorn bin injured   would yeh know anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 about it?\" Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. \"Mars is bright tonight,\" he said simply. \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve heard,\" said Hagrid grumpily. \"Well, if either of you do see anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99, let me know, won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t yeh? We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be off, then.\" Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view. \"Never,\" said Hagrid irritably, \"try an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 get a straight answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 closer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99n the moon.\" \"Are there many of them in here?\" asked Hermione. \"Oh, a fair few .Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re good enough about turnin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 up if ever I want a word. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re deep, mind, centaurs they know things jus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 let on much.\"  \"D\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?\" said Harry. \"Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s bin killin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 the unicorns \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 never heard anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 like it before.\" They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arm. \"Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!\" \"You two wait here!\" Hagrid shouted. \"Stay on the path, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll come back for yeh!\" They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them. \"You don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been hurt, do you?\" whispered Hermione. \"I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t care if Malfoy has, but if something\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got Neville it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s our fault he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s here in the first place.\" The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others? At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks. \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be lucky ter catch anythin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 now, with the racket you two were makin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99. Right, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re changin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 groups   Neville, you stay with me an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 this idiot. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sorry,\" Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, \"but he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have a harder time frightenin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 you, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve gotta get this done.\" So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak. \"Look  \" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy. Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer. It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles  where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves. Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered. Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s side, and began to drink its blood. \"AAAAAAAAAARGH!\" Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted   so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry   unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry   he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t move for fear. Then a pain like he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure. The pain in Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body. \"Are you all right?\" said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet. \"Yes   thank you   what was that?\" The centaur didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s forehead. \"You are the Potter boy,\" he said. \"You had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time   especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way. \"My name is Firenze,\" he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back. There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty. \"Firenze!\" Bane thundered. \"What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\" \"Do you realize who this is?\" said Firenze. \"This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.\" \"What have you been telling him?\" growled Bane. \"Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is  to come in the movements of the planets?\" Ronan pawed the ground nervously. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best, \" he said in his gloomy voice. Bane kicked his back legs in anger. \"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!\" Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on. \"Do you not see that unicorn?\" Firenze bellowed at Bane. \"Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.\" And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them. Harry didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have a clue what was going on. \"Why\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Bane so angry?\" he asked. \"What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?\" Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped. \"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?\" \"No,\" said Harry, startled by the odd question. \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.\" \"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\" said Firenze. \"Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.\" Harry stared at the back of Firenze\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight. \"But who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be that desperate?\" he wondered aloud. \"If you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to be cursed forever, death\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s better, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\" \"It is,\" Firenze agreed, \"unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else   something that will bring you back to full strength and power   something that will mean you can never die. Mr Potter, do you  know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\" \"The Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone! Of course   the Elixir of Life! But I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t understand who  \" \"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\" It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: \"Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.\" \"Do you mean,\" Harry croaked, \"that was Vol-\" \"Harry! Harry, are you all right?\" Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m fine,\" said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. \"The unicorn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dead, Hagrid, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s in that clearing back there.\" \"This is where I leave you,\" Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. \"You are safe now.\" Harry slid off his back. \"Good luck, Harry Potter,\" said Firenze. \"The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.\" He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him. Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest. Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking. \"Snape wants the stone for Voldemort and Voldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s waiting in the forest and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich .\" \"Stop saying the name!\" said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them. Harry wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t listening. \"Firenze saved me, but he shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have done so. Bane was furious  he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen .They must show that Voldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coming back. Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me. I suppose that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s written in the stars as well.\" \"Will you stop saying the name!\" Ron hissed.  \"So all I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,\" Harry went on feverishly, \"then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off ... Well, I suppose Bane\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be happy.\" Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort. \"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of with Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a very imprecise branch of magic.\" The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s surprises weren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t over. When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it: Just in case.   In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door. It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anticheating spell. They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox   points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion. Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it. Maybe it was because they hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to. Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d invented selfstirring cauldrons and they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t help cheering with the rest. \"That was far easier than I thought it would be,\" said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \"I needn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have learned  about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.\" Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. \"No more studying,\" Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. \"You could look more cheerful, Harry, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got a week before we find out how badly we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve done, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no need to worry yet.\" Harry was rubbing his forehead. \"I wish I knew what this means!\" he burst out angrily. \"My scar keeps hurting   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s happened before, but never as often as this.\" \"Go to Madam Pomfrey,\" Hermione suggested. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not ill,\" said Harry. \"I think it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a warning it means danger\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coming .\" Ron couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t get worked up, it was too hot. \"Harry, relax, Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s right, the Stone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s safe as long as Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s around. Anyway, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\" Harry nodded, but he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, \"That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d done that one.\" Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy never but . Harry suddenly jumped to his feet. \"Where\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re you going?\" said Ron sleepily. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve just thought of something,\" said Harry. He had turned white. \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.\" \"Why?\" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you think it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a bit odd,\" said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, \"that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s against wizard law? Lucky they  found Hagrid, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you think? Why didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t I see it before?\" \"What are you talking about?\" said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t answer. Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl. \"Hullo,\" he said, smiling. \"Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?\" \"Yes, please,\" said Ron, but Harry cut him off. \"No, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re in a hurry. Hagrid, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?\" \"Dunno,\" said Hagrid casually, \"he wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 take his cloak off.\" He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 funny folk in the Hog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Head   that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.\" Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \"What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\" \"Mighta come up,\" said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. \"Yeah he asked what I did, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I told him I was gamekeeper here He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after so I told him an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I said what I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d always really wanted was a dragon an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 then I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 remember too well,  cause he kept buyin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 me drinks Let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s see yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 we could play cards fer it if I wanted but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 want it ter go ter any old home .So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy. \" \"And did he   did he seem interested in Fluffy?\" Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm. \"Well   yeah   how many three-headed dogs d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a piece o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 play him a bit o\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 music an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll go straight off ter sleep  \" Hagrid suddenly looked horrified. \"I shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ta told yeh that!\" he blurted out. \"Forget I said it! Hey   where\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re yeh goin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99?\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds. \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to go to Dumbledore,\" said Harry. \"Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak   it must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been easy, once he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore  believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t stop him. Where\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s office?\" They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him. \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll just have to  \" Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall. \"What are you three doing inside?\" It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books. \"We want to see Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought. \"See Professor Dumbledore?\" Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. \"Why?\" Harry swallowed   now what? \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sort of secret,\" he said, but he wished at once he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, because Professor McGonagall\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s nostrils flared. \"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\" she said coldly. \"He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.\" \"He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone?\" said Harry frantically. \"Now?\" \"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 \" \"But this is important.\" \"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?\" \"Look,\" said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \"Professor   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s about the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone  \" Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t pick them up. \"How do you know  ?\" she spluttered. \"Professor, I think   I know   that Sn  that someone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to try and steal the Stone. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.\" She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion. \"Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\" she said finally. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s too well protected.\" \"But Professor  \" \"Potter, I know what I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m talking about,\" she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the  sunshine.\" But they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s tonight,\" said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. \"Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going through the trapdoor tonight. He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s found out everything he needs, and now he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.\" \"But what can we  \" Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round. Snape was standing there. \"Good afternoon,\" he said smoothly. They stared at him. \"You shouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be inside on a day like this,\" he said, with an odd, twisted smile. \"We were  \" Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say. \"You want to be more careful,\" said Snape. \"Hanging around like this, people will think you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re up to something. And Gryffindor really can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t afford to lose any more points, can it?\" Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back. \"Be warned, Potter   any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.\" He strode off in the direction of the staffroom. Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others. \"Right, here\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to do,\" he whispered urgently. \"One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape   wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better do that.\" \"Why me?\" \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s obvious,\" said Ron. \"You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.\" He put on a high voice, \" Oh Professor Flitwick, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong .\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\" \"Oh, shut up,\" said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape. \"And we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,\" Harry told Ron. \"Come on.\" But that part of the plan didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper. \"I suppose you think you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!\" she stormed. \"Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve come  anywhere near here again, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!\" Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, \"At least Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s on Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s tail,\" when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sorry, Harry!\" she wailed. \"Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve only just got away, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know where Snape went.\" \"Well, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s it then, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\" Harry said. The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going out of here tonight and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to try and get to the Stone first.\" \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re mad!\" said Ron. \"You can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t!\" said Hermione. \"After what McGonagall and Snape have said? You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be expelled!\" \"SO WHAT\" Harry shouted. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s coming back! Haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t matter anymore, can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you see? D\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99you think he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m never going over to the Dark Side! I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\" He glared at them. \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re right Harry,\" said Hermione in a small voice. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll use the invisibility cloak,\" said Harry. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just lucky I got it back.\" \"But will it cover all three of us?\" said Ron. \"All   all three of us?\" \"Oh, come off it, you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d let you go alone?\" \"Of course not,\" said Hermione briskly. \"How do you think you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d get to the Stone without us? I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better go and took through my books, there might be something useful .\" \"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\" \"Not if I can help it,\" said Hermione grimly. \"Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not throwing me out after that.\"  After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do. Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. \"Better get the cloak,\" Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy   he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel much like singing. He ran back down to the common room. \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own  \" \"What are you doing?\" said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been making another bid for freedom. \"Nothing, Neville, nothing,\" said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back. Neville stared at their guilty faces. \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going out again,\" he said. \"No, no, no,\" said Hermione. \"No, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not. Why don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you go to bed, Neville?\" Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep. \"You can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t go out,\" said Neville, \"you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.\" \"You don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t understand,\" said Harry, \"this is important.\" But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate. I won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t let you do it,\" he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll fight you!\" \"Neville, \"Ron exploded, \"get away from that hole and don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be an idiot  \" \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you call me an idiot!\" said Neville. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!\" \"Yes, but not to us,\" said Ron in exasperation. \"Neville, you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know what you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re doing.\" He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt  out of sight. \"Go on then, try and hit me!\" said Neville, raising his fists. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m ready!\" Harry turned to Hermione. \"Do something,\" he said desperately. Hermione stepped forward. \"Neville,\" she said, \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m really, really sorry about this.\" She raised her wand. \"Petrificus Totalus!\" she cried, pointing it at Neville. Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board. Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s jaws were jammed together so he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror. \"What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve you done to him?\" Harry whispered. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the full Body-Bind,\" said Hermione miserably. \"Oh, Neville, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m so sorry.\" \"We had to, Neville, no time to explain,\" said Harry. \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll understand later, Neville,\" said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak. But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs Norris skulking near the top. \"Oh, let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s kick her, just this once,\" Ron whispered in Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do anything. They didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip. \"Who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s there?\" he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. \"Know you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re there, even if I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\" He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them. \"Should call Filch, I should, if something\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a-creeping around unseen.\" Harry had a sudden idea. \"Peeves,\" he said, in a hoarse whisper, \"the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.\" Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs.  \"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr Baron, Sir,\" he said greasily. \"My mistake, my mistake   I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see you   of course I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re invisible   forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.\" \"I have business here, Peeves,\" croaked Harry. \"Stay away from this place tonight.\" \"I will, sir, I most certainly will,\" said Peeves, rising up in the air again. \"Hope your business goes well, Baron, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll not bother you.\" And he scooted off. \"Brilliant, Harry!\" whispered Ron. A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor   and the door was already ajar. \"Well, there you are,\" Harry said quietly, \"Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s already got past Fluffy.\" Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two. \"If you want to go back, I won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t blame you,\" he said. \"You can take the cloak, I won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t need it now.\" \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be stupid,\" said Ron. \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re coming,\" said Hermione. Harry pushed the door open. As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see them. \"What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s that at its feet?\" Hermione whispered. \"Looks like a harp,\" said Ron. \"Snape must have left it there.\" \"It must wake up the moment you stop playing,\" said Harry. \"Well, here goes  .\" He put Hagrid\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t really a tune, but from the first note the beast\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s growls ceased   it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep. \"Keep playing,\" Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. \"I think we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be able to pull the door open,\" said Ron, peering over the dog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s back. \"Want to go first, Hermione?\" \"No, I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t!\" \"All right.\" Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open. \"What can you see?\" Hermione said anxiously. \"Nothing   just black   there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no way of climbing down, we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll just  have to drop.\" Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself. \"You want to go first? Are you sure?\" said Ron. \"I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.\" Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep. Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom. He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \"If anything happens to me, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?\" \"Right,\" said Ron. \"See you in a minute, I hope  \" And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and   FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s okay!\" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \"it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a soft landing, you can jump!\" Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry. \"What\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s this stuff?\" were his first words. \"Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!\" The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s other side. \"We must be miles under the school,\" she said. \"Lucky this plant thing\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s here, really,\" said Ron. \"Lucky!\" shrieked Hermione. \"Look at you both!\" She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing. Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.  \"Stop moving!\" Hermione ordered them. \"I know what this is   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Devil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Snare!\" \"Oh, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m so glad we know what it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s called, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a great help,\" snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. \"Shut up, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m trying to remember how to kill it!\" said Hermione. \"Well, hurry up, I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t breathe!\" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest. \"Devil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Snare, Devil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Snare what did Professor Sprout say?   it likes the dark and the damp.\" \"So light a fire!\" Harry choked. \"Yes   of course   but there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no wood!\" Hermione cried, wringing her hands. \"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?\" Ron bellowed. \"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\" \"Oh, right!\" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free. \"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\" said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face. \"Yeah,\" said Ron, \"and lucky Harry doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t lose his head in a crisis    there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no wood,\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 honestly.\" \"This way,\" said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward. All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon   Norbert had been bad enough . \"Can you hear something?\" Ron whispered. Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead. \"Do you think it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a ghost?\" \"I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know sounds like wings to me.\" \"There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s light ahead   I can see something moving.\" They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite  side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door. \"Do you think they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll attack us if we cross the room?\" said Ron. \"Probably,\" said Harry. \"They don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once well, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s no other choice I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll run.\" He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked. The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm. \"Now what?\" said Ron. \"These birds they can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be here just for decoration,\" said Hermione. They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering   glittering? \"They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not birds!\" Harry said suddenly. \"They\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re keys! Winged keys   look carefully. So that must mean \" he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \" yes   look! Broomsticks! We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to catch the key to the door!\" \"But there are hundreds of them!\" Ron examined the lock on the door. \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re looking for a big, old-fashioned one   probably silver, like the handle.\" They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one. Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. After a minute\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole. \"That one!\" he called to the others. \"That big one   there   no, there   with bright blue wings   the feathers are all crumpled on one side.\" Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom. \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to close in on it!\" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. \"Ron, you come at it from above   Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!\" Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and  Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cheers echoed around the high chamber. They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice. \"Ready?\" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open. The next chamber was so dark they couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight. They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93 the towering white chessmen had no faces. \"Now what do we do?\" Harry whispered. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s obvious, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it?\" said Ron. \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to play our way across the room.\" Behind the white pieces they could see another door. \"How?\" said Hermione nervously. \"I think,\" said Ron, \"we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re going to have to be chessmen.\" He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron. \"Do we   er   have to join you to get across?\" The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two. \"This needs thinking about \" he said. \"I suppose we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces .\" Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, \"Now, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess  \" \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not offended,\" said Harry quickly. \"Just tell us what to do.\" \"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you next to him instead of that castle.\" \"What about you?\" \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to be a knight,\" said Ron. The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.  \"White always plays first in chess,\" said Ron, peering across the board. \"Yes look \" A white pawn had moved forward two squares. Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s knees were trembling. What if they lost? \"Harry   move diagonally four squares to the right.\" Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown. \"Had to let that happen,\" said Ron, looking shaken. \"Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\" Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones. \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re nearly there,\" he muttered suddenly. \"Let me think   let me think \" The white queen turned her blank face toward him. \"Yes \" said Ron softly, \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s the only way I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to be taken.\" \"NO!\" Harry and Hermione shouted. \"That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s chess!\" snapped Ron. \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll take me   that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!\" \"But  \" \"Do you want to stop Snape or not?\" \"Ron  \" \"Look, if you don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t hurry up, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll already have the Stone!\" There was no alternative. \"Ready?\" Ron called, his face pale but determined. \"Here I go   now, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t hang around once you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve won.\" He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor   Hermione screamed but stayed on her square   the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d been knocked out. Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door  and up the next passageway. \"What if he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s  ?\" \"He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be all right,\" said Harry, trying to convince himself. \"What do you reckon\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s next?\" \"We\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had Sprout\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s, that was the Devil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Snare; Flitwick must\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s spell, and Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s.\" They had reached another door. \"All right?\" Harry whispered. \"Go on.\" Harry pushed it open. A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m glad we didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have to fight that one,\" Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \"Come on, I can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t breathe.\" He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line. \"Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s,\" said Harry. \"What do we have to do?\" They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped. \"Look!\" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it: Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, Two of us will help you, which ever you would find, One among us seven will let you move ahead, Another will transport the drinker back instead, Two among our number hold only nettle wine, Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line. Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: First, however slyly the poison tries to hide You will always find some on nettle wine\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s left side; Second, different are those who stand at either end, But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;  Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; Fourth, the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight. Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing. \"Brilliant,\" said Hermione. \"This isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t magic   it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s logic   a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got an ounce of logic, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be stuck in here forever.\" \"But so will we, won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t we?\" \"Of course not,\" said Hermione. \"Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.\" \"But how do we know which to drink?\" \"Give me a minute.\" Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands. \"Got it,\" she said. \"The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire   toward the Stone.\" Harry looked at the tiny bottle. \"There\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s only enough there for one of us,\" he said. \"That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hardly one swallow.\" They looked at each other. \"Which one will get you back through the purple flames?\" Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line. \"You drink that,\" said Harry. \"No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy   go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m no match for him, really.\" \"But Harry   what if You-Know-Who\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s with him?\" \"Well   I was lucky once, wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t I?\" said Harry, pointing at his scar. \"I might get lucky again.\" Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him. \"Hermione!\" \"Harry   you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re a great wizard, you know.\"  \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m not as good as you,\" said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him. \"Me!\" said Hermione. \"Books! And cleverness! There are more important things   friendship and bravery and   oh Harry   be careful!\" \"You drink first,\" said Harry. \"You are sure which is which, aren\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you?\" \"Positive,\" said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not poison?\" said Harry anxiously. \"No   but it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s like ice.\" \"Quick, go, before it wears off.\" \"Good luck   take care.\" \"GO!\" Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire. Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames. \"Here I come,\" he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp. It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t feel them   for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire   then he was on the other side, in the last chamber. There was already someone there   but it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t Snape. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even Voldemort.   It was Quirrell. \"You!\" gasped Harry. Quirrell smiled. His face wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t twitching at all. \"Me,\" he said calmly. \"I wondered whether I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d be meeting you here, Potter.\" \"But I thought   Snape  \" \"Severus?\" Quirrell laughed, and it wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. \"Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?\" Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t take it in. This couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be true, it couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t. \"But Snape tried to kill me!\" \"No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have got you off that broom. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have managed it before then if Snape hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.\" \"Snape was trying to save me?\" \"Of course,\" said Quirrell coolly. \"Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do it again. Funny, really he needn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have bothered. I couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular and what a waste of time, when after all that, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going to kill you tonight.\" Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry. \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.\" \"You let the troll in?\" \"Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls   you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else  was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off   and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t even manage to bite Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s leg off properly. \"Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.\" It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised. \"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\" Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. \"Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this but he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s in London I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be far away by the time he gets back \" All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror. \"I saw you and Snape in the forest  \" he blurted out. \"Yes,\" said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. \"He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me   as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side .\" Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it. \"I see the Stone I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m presenting it to my master but where is it?\" Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror. \"But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\" \"Oh, he does,\" said Quirrell casually, \"heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead.\" \"But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing   I thought Snape was threatening you. \" For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face. \"Sometimes,\" he said, \"I find it hard to follow my master\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s instructions   he is a great wizard and I am weak  \" \"You mean he was there in the classroom with you?\" Harry gasped. \"He is with me wherever I go,\" said Quirrell quietly. \"I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.\" Quirrell shivered suddenly. \"He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me decided he would have to keep a closer watch on  me. \" Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley   how could he have been so stupid? He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron. Quirrell cursed under his breath. \"I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t understand is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?\" Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s mind was racing. What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myself finding it   which means I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll see where it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m up to? He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself. \"What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!\" And to Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself. \"Use the boy Use the boy. \" Quirrell rounded on Harry. \"Yes   Potter   come here.\" He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet. \"Come here,\" Quirrell repeated. \"Look in the mirror and tell me what you see.\" Harry walked toward him. I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what I see, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all. Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again. He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket   and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow   incredibly   he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d gotten the Stone. \"Well?\" said Quirrell impatiently. \"What do you see?\" Harry screwed up his courage. \"I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\" he invented. \"I   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve won the house cup for Gryffindor.\"  Quirrell cursed again. \"Get out of the way,\" he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it? But he hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t moving his lips. \"He lies He lies. \" \"Potter, come back here!\" Quirrell shouted. \"Tell me the truth! What did you just see?\" The high voice spoke again. \"Let me speak to him face-to-face \" \"Master, you are not strong enough!\" \"I have strength enough for this \" Harry felt as if Devil\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot. Harry would have screamed, but he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake. \"Harry Potter \" it whispered. Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t move. \"See what I have become?\" the face said. \"Mere shadow and vapor .I have form only when I can share another\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s body but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my own .Now why don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you give me that Stone in your pocket?\" So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s legs. He stumbled backward. \"Don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t be a fool,\" snarled the face. \"Better save your own life and join me or you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll meet the same end as your parents They died begging me for mercy \" \"LIAR!\" Harry shouted suddenly. Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now smiling. \"How touching \" it hissed. \"I always value bravery .Yes, boy, your parents were brave I killed your father first; and he put up a courageous fight but your mother needn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have died she was trying to protect you Now  give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.\" \"NEVER!\" Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed \"SEIZE HIM!\" and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened   he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers   they were blistering before his eyes. \"Seize him! SEIZE HIM!\" shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet landing on top of him, both hands around Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s neck   Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony. \"Master, I cannot hold him   my hands   my hands!\" And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms   Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny. \"Then kill him, fool, and be done!\" screeched Voldemort. Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face   \"AAAARGH!\" Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain   his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse. Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off   the pain in Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s head was building   he couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t see   he could only hear Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s terrible shrieks and Voldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s yells of, \"KILL HIM! KILL HIM!\" and other voices, maybe in Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s own head, crying, \"Harry! Harry!\" He felt Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down down  down . Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy. He blinked. It wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange. He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him.  \"Good afternoon, Harry,\" said Dumbledore. Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: \"Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s got the Stone! Sir, quick  \" \"Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,\" said Dumbledore. \"Quirrell does not have the Stone.\" \"Then who does? Sir, I  \" \"Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.\" Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop. \"Tokens from your friends and admirers,\" said Dumbledore, beaming. \"What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.\" \"How long have I been in here?\" \"Three days. Mr Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.\" \"But sir, the Stone  \" \"I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.\" \"You got there? You got Hermione\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s owl?\" \"We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.\" \"It was you.\" \"I feared I might be too late.\" \"You nearly were, I couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have kept him off the Stone much longer \\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x93\" \"Not the Stone, boy, you   the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.\" \"Destroyed?\" said Harry blankly. \"But your friend   Nicolas Flamel  \" \"Oh, you know about Nicolas?\" said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. \"You did do the thing properly, didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s all for the best.\" \"But that means he and his wife will die, won\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t they?\" \"They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes,  they will die.\" Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s face. \"To one as young as you, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all   the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\" Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling. \"Sir?\" said Harry. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve been thinking sir   even if the Stone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who  \" \"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.\" \"Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s going to try other ways of coming back, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he? I mean, he hasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t gone, has he?\" \"No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time   and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.\" Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then he said, \"Sir, there are some other things I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d like to know, if you can tell me  things I want to know the truth about. \" \"The truth.\" Dumbledore sighed. \"It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.\" \"Well Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?\" Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time. \"Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older I know you hate to hear this when you are ready, you will know.\" And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.  \"But why couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t Quirrell touch me?\" \"Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t realize that love as powerful as your mother\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.\" Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said, \"And the invisibility cloak   do you know who sent it to me?\" \"Ah   your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.\" Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eyes twinkled. \"Useful things your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.\" \"And there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s something else \" \"Fire away.\" \"Quirrell said Snape  \" \"Professor Snape, Harry.\" \"Yes, him   Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?\" \"Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.\" \"What?\" \"He saved his life.\" \"What?\" \"Yes \" said Dumbledore dreamily. \"Funny, the way people\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s minds work, isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t it? Professor Snape couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t bear being in your father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s debt I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s memory in peace. \" Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped. \"And sir, there\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s one more thing \" \"Just the one?\" \"How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?\" \"Ah, now, I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone   find it, but not use it   would be able to get it, otherwise they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My  brain surprises even me sometimes Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m afraid I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve rather lost my liking for them   but I think I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be safe with a nice toffee, don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t you?\" He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, \"Alas! Ear wax!\" Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict. \"Just five minutes,\" Harry pleaded. \"Absolutely not.\" \"You let Professor Dumbledore in .\" \"Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.\" \"I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey \" \"Oh, very well,\" she said. \"But five minutes only.\" And she let Ron and Hermione in. \"Harry!\" Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore. \"Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to   Dumbledore was so worried  \" \"The whole school\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s talking about it,\" said Ron. \"What really happened?\" It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s turban, Hermione screamed out loud. \"So the Stone\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone?\" said Ron finally. \"Flamel\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s just going to die?\" \"That\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that   what was it?    to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99\" \"I always said he was off his rocker,\" said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was. \"So what happened to you two?\" said Harry. \"Well, I got back all right,\" said Hermione. \"I brought Ron round   that took a while   and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall   he already knew   he just said,  Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone after him, hasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t he?\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 and hurtled off to the third floor.\"  \"D\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99you think he meant you to do it?\" said Ron. \"Sending you your father\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s cloak and everything?\" \"Well, \" Hermione exploded, \"if he did   I mean to say that\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s terrible   you could have been killed.\" \"No, it isn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t,\" said Harry thoughtfully. \"He\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could .\" \"Yeah, Dumbledore\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s off his rocker, all right,\" said Ron proudly. \"Listen, you\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course   you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you   but the food\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll be good.\" At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over. \"You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT\" she said firmly. After a good night\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal. I want to go to the feast,\" he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. I can, can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t I?\" \"Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,\" she said stiffly, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t realize how risky feasts could be. \"And you have another visitor.\" \"Oh, good,\" said Harry. \"Who is it?\" Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears. \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s   all   my   ruddy   fault!\" he sobbed, his face in his hands. I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know, an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 I told him! Yeh could\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve died! All fer a dragon egg! I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll never drink again! I should be chucked out an\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 made ter live as a Muggle!\" \"Hagrid!\" said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. \"Hagrid, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re talking about, he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d have found out even if you hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t told him.\" \"Yeh could\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve died!\" sobbed Hagrid. \"An\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 say the name!\" \"VOLDEMORT!\" Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying. \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve met him and I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s gone, he can\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t use it. Have a Chocolate Frog,  I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got loads. \" Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, \"That reminds me. I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ve got yeh a present.\" \"It\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s not a stoat sandwich, is it?\" said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle. \"Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it.  course, he shoulda sacked me instead   anyway, got yeh this. \" It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father. \"Sent owls off ter all yer parents\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 old school friends, askin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 fer photos  knew yeh didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 have any d\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99yeh like it?\" Harry couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t speak, but Hagrid understood. Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table. When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him. Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away. \"Another year gone!\" Dumbledore said cheerfully. \"And I must trouble you with an old man\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts.  \"Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.\" A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight. \"Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,\" said Dumbledore. \"However, recent events must be taken into account.\"  The room went very still. The Slytherins\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 smiles faded a little. \"Ahem,\" said Dumbledore. \"I have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes  \"First   to Mr Ronald Weasley \" Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn. \" for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\" Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, \"My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s giant chess set!\" At last there was silence again. \"Second   to Miss Hermione Granger for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\" Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves   they were a hundred points up. \"Third   to Mr Harry Potter \" said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet. \" for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.\" The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points   exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup   if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point. Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent. \"There are all kinds of courage,\" said Dumbledore, smiling. \"It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr Neville Longbottom.\" Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have looked more stunned and horrified if he\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him. \"Which means,\" Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \"we need a little change of decoration.\" He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering  Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s feelings toward him hadn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t changed one jot. This didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts. It was the best evening of Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls he would never, ever forget tonight. Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t have everything in life. And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (\"I always hope they\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll forget to give us these,\" said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s Cross Station. It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles. \"You must come and stay this summer,\" said Ron, \"both of you   I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll send you an owl.\" \"Thanks,\" said Harry, \"I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll need something to look forward to.\" People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called: \"Bye, Harry!\" \"See you, Potter!\" \"Still famous,\" said Ron, grinning at him. \"Not where I\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99m going, I promise you,\" said Harry. He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. \"There he  is, Mom, there he is, look!\" It was Ginny Weasley, Ron\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s younger sister, but she wasn\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t pointing at Ron. \"Harry Potter!\" she squealed. \"Look, Mom! I can see  \" \"Be quiet, Ginny, and it\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s rude to point.\" Mrs Weasley smiled down at them. \"Busy year?\" she said. \"Very,\" said Harry. \"Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs Weasley.\" \"Oh, it was nothing, dear.\" \"Ready, are you?\" It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry. \"You must be Harry\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s family!\" said Mrs Weasley. \"In a manner of speaking,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"Hurry up, boy, we haven\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t got all day.\" He walked away. Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione. \"See you over the summer, then.\" \"Hope you have   er   a good holiday,\" said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant. \"Oh, I will,\" said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. \"They don\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99t know we\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99re not allowed to use magic at home.

Howard, isn't it?\" \"Harry\n"," Nasty, common name, if you ask me\n","\" \"Oh, yes,\" said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly\n"," \"Yes, I quite agree\n","\" He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed\n"," While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden\n"," The cat was still there\n"," It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something\n"," Was he imagining things?

When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here\n","\" Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily\n"," \"Oh yes, I've celebrating, all right,\" she said impatiently\n"," \"You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no even the Muggles have noticed something's going on\n"," It was on their news\n","\" She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living-room window\n"," \"I heard it\n"," Flocks of owls shooting stars Well, they're not completely stupid\n"," They were bound to notice something\n"," Shooting stars down in Kent I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle\n"," He never had much sense\n","\" \"You can't blame them,\" said Dumbledore gently\n"," \"We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years\n","\" \"I know that,\" said Professor McGonagall irritably\n"," \"But that's no reason to lose our heads\n"," People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors\n","\" She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on\n"," \"A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all\n"," I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?\" \"It certainly seems so,\" said Dumbledore\n"," \"We have much to be thankful for\n"," Would you care for a lemon drop?\" \"A what?\" \"A lemon drop\n"," They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of\n","\" \"No, thank you,\" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn't think this was the moment for lemon drops\n"," \"As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone \" \"My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this You-Know-Who' nonsense for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort\n","\" Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice\n"," \"It all gets so confusing if we keep saying You-KnowWho\n","' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name\n","\" \"I know you haven't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring\n"," \"But you're different\n"," Everyone knows you're the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of\n","\" \"You flatter me,\" said Dumbledore calmly\n"," \"Voldemort had powers I will never have\n","\" \"Only because you're too well noble to use them\n","\" \"It's lucky it's dark\n"," I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs\n","\" Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said \"The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around\n"," You know what they're saying? About why he's disappeared? About what finally stopped him?\" It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now\n"," It was plain that whatever \"everyone\" was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true\n"," Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer\n"," \"What they're saying,\" she pressed on, \"is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow\n"," He went to find the Potters\n"," The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are are that they're dead\n","\" Dumbledore bowed his head\n"," Professor McGonagall gasped\n"," \"Lily and James I can't believe it I didn't want to believe it Oh, Albus \" Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder\n"," \"I know I know \" he said heavily\n"," Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on\n"," \"That's not all\n"," They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry\n"," But he couldn't\n"," He couldn't kill that little boy\n"," No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow broke and that's why he's gone\n","\" Dumbledore nodded glumly\n"," \"It's it's true?\" faltered Professor McGonagall\n"," \"After all he's done all the people he's killed he couldn't kill a little boy? It's just astounding of all the things to stop him but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\" \"We can only guess\n","\" said Dumbledore\n"," \"We may never know\n","\" Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles\n"," Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it\n"," It was a very odd watch\n"," It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge\n"," It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, \"Hagrid's late\n"," I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here, by the way?\" \"Yes,\" said Professor McGonagall\n"," \"And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here, of all places?\" \"I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle\n"," They're the only family he has left now\n","\" \"You don't mean \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you can't mean the people who live here?\" cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four\n"," \"Dumbledore you can't\n"," I've been watching them all day\n"," You couldn't find two people who are less like us\n"," And they've got this son I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets\n"," Harry Potter come and live here!\" \"It's the best place for him,\" said Dumbledore firmly\n"," \"His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older\n"," I've written them a letter\n","\" \"A letter?\" repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall\n"," \"Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He'll be famous a legend I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future there will be books written about Harry every child in our world will know his name!\" \"Exactly\n","\" said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses\n"," \"It would be enough to turn any boy's head\n"," Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even remember! Can you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?\" Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, \"Yes yes, you're right, of course\n"," But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?\" She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it\n"," \"Hagrid's bringing him\n","\" \"You think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?\" \"I would trust Hagrid with my life,\" said Dumbledore\n"," \"I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place,\" said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, \"but you can't pretend he's not careless\n"," He does tend to what was that?\" A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them\n"," It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them\n"," If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it\n"," He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide\n"," He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins\n"," In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets\n"," \"Hagrid,\" said Dumbledore, sounding relieved\n"," \"At last\n"," And where did you get that motorcycle?\" \"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\" said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke\n"," \"Young Sirius Black lent it to me\n"," I've got him, sir\n","\" \"No problems, were there?\" \"No, sir house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around\n"," He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol\n","\" Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets\n"," Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep\n"," Under a tuft of jetblack hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning\n"," \"Is that where ?\" whispered Professor McGonagall\n"," \"Yes,\" said Dumbledore\n"," \"He'll have that scar forever\n","\" \"Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?\" \"Even if I could, I wouldn't\n"," Scars can come in handy\n"," I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground\n"," Well give him here, Hagrid we'd better get this over with\n","\" Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house\n"," \"Could I could I say good-bye to him, sir?\" asked Hagrid\n"," He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss\n"," Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog\n"," \"Shhh!\" hissed Professor McGonagall, \"You'll wake the Muggles!\" \"S-s-sorry,\" sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it\n"," \"But I c-c-can't stand it Lily an' James dead an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles \" \"Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be found,\" Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door\n"," He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two\n"," For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out\n"," \"Well,\" said Dumbledore finally, \"that's that\n"," We've no business staying here\n"," We may as well go and join the celebrations\n","\" \"Yeah,\" said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, \"I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back\n"," G'night, Professor McGonagall Professor Dumbledore, sir\n","\" Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night\n"," \"I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\" said Dumbledore, nodding to her\n"," Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply\n"," Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street\n"," On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer\n"," He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street\n"," He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four\n"," \"Good luck, Harry,\" he murmured\n"," He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone\n"," A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen\n"," Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up\n"," One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley\n","\n","\n","\n","He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \"To Harry Potter the boy who lived!\" In early ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all\n"," The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls\n"," Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed\n"," Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother\n"," The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too\n"," Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long\n"," His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day\n"," \"Up! Get up! Now!\" Harry woke with a start\n"," His aunt rapped on the door again\n"," \"Up!\" she screeched\n"," Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove\n"," He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having\n"," It had been a good one\n"," There had been a flying motorcycle in it\n"," He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before\n"," His aunt was back outside the door\n"," \"Are you up yet?\" she demanded\n"," \"Nearly,\" said Harry\n"," \"Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon\n"," And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday\n","\" Harry groaned\n"," \"What did you say?\" his aunt snapped through the door\n"," \"Nothing, nothing \" Dudley's birthday how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks\n"," He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on\n"," Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept\n"," When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen\n"," The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents\n"," It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike\n"," Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise unless of course it involved punching somebody\n"," Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him\n"," Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast\n"," Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age\n"," He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was\n"," Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes\n"," He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose\n"," The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning\n"," He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it\n"," \"In the car crash when your parents died,\" she had said\n"," \"And don't ask questions\n","\" Don't ask questions that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys\n"," Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon\n"," \"Comb your hair!\" he barked, by way of a morning greeting\n"," About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut\n"," Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way all over the place\n"," Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother\n"," Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon\n"," He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head\n"," Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig\n"," Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room\n"," Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents\n"," His face fell\n"," \"Thirty-six,\" he said, looking up at his mother and father\n"," \"That's two less than last year\n","\" \"Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here under this big one from Mummy and Daddy\n","\" \"All right, thirty-seven then,\" said Dudley, going red in the face\n"," Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over\n"," Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, \"And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today\n"," How's that, popkin? Two more presents\n"," Is that all right\" Dudley thought for a moment\n"," It looked like hard work\n"," Finally he said slowly, \"So I'll have thirty\n","\n","\n","thirty\n","\n","\n","\" \"Thirty-nine, sweetums,\" said Aunt Petunia\n"," \"Oh\n","\" Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel\n"," \"All right then\n","\" Uncle Vernon chuckled\n"," \"Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father\n"," 'Atta boy, Dudley!\" He ruffled Dudley's hair\n"," At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR\n"," He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried\n"," \"Bad news, Vernon,\" she said\n"," \"Mrs Figg's broken her leg\n"," She can't take him\n","\" She jerked her head in Harry's direction\n"," Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap\n"," Every year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies\n"," Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away\n"," Harry hated it there\n"," The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned\n"," \"Now what?\" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he'd planned this\n"," Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr Paws, and Tufty again\n"," \"We could phone Marge,\" Uncle Vernon suggested\n"," \"Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy\n","\" The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't there or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug\n"," \"What about what's-her-name, your friend Yvonne?\" \"On vacation in Majorca,\" snapped Aunt Petunia\n"," \"You could just leave me here,\" Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley's computer)\n"," Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon\n"," \"And come back and find the house in ruins?\" she snarled\n"," \"I won't blow up the house,\" said Harry, but they weren't listening\n"," \"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\" said Aunt Petunia slowly, \" and leave him in the car\n"," \" \"That car's new, he's not sitting in it alone\n"," \" Dudley began to cry loudly\n"," In fact, he wasn't really crying it had been years since he'd really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted\n"," \"Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!\" she cried, flinging her arms around him\n"," \"I don't want him t-t-to come!\" Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs\n"," \"He always sp-spoils everything!\" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother's arms\n"," Just then, the doorbell rang \"Oh, good Lord, they're here!\" said Aunt Petunia frantically and a moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother\n"," Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat\n"," He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them\n"," Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once\n"," Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life\n"," His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside\n"," \"I'm warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry's, \"I'm warning you now, boy any funny business, anything at all and you'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas\n","\" \"I'm not going to do anything,\" said Harry, \"honestly \" But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him\n"," No one ever did\n"," The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen\n"," Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar\n","\" Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses\n"," Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly\n"," Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls)\n"," The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry\n"," Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished\n"," On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens\n"," Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney\n"," The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings\n"," But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors\n"," Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump\n"," But today, nothing was going to go wrong\n"," It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or Mrs Figg's cabbage-smelling living room\n"," While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia\n"," He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects\n"," This morning, it was motorcycles\n"," \" roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\" he said, as a motorcycle overtook them\n"," \"I had a dream about a motorcycle,\" said Harry, remembering suddenly\n"," \"It was flying\n","\" Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front\n"," He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \"MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!\" Dudley and Piers sniggered\n"," \"I know they don't,\" said Harry\n"," \"It was only a dream\n","\" But he wished he hadn't said anything\n"," If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas\n"," It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families\n"," The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop\n"," It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn't blond\n"," Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time\n"," He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him\n"," They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first\n"," Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last\n"," After lunch they went to the reptile house\n"," It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls\n"," Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone\n"," Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons\n"," Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place\n"," It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can but at the moment it didn't look in the mood\n"," In fact, it was fast asleep\n"," Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils\n"," \"Make it move,\" he whined at his father\n"," Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn't budge\n"," \"Do it again,\" Dudley ordered\n"," Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on\n"," \"This is boring,\" Dudley moaned\n"," He shuffled away\n"," Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake\n"," He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long\n"," It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house\n"," The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes\n"," Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's\n"," It winked\n"," Harry stared\n"," Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching\n"," They weren't\n"," He looked back at the snake and winked, too\n"," The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling\n"," It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly: \"I get that all the time\n","\" \"I know,\" Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him\n"," \"It must be really annoying\n","\" The snake nodded vigorously\n"," \"Where do you come from, anyway?\" Harry asked\n"," The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass\n"," Harry peered at it\n"," Boa Constrictor, Brazil\n"," \"Was it nice there?\" The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo\n"," \"Oh, I see so you've never been to Brazil?\" As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump\n"," \"DUDLEY! Mr DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT IT'S DOING!\" Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could\n"," \"Out of the way, you,\" he said, punching Harry in the ribs\n"," Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor\n"," What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror\n"," Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished\n"," The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor\n"," People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits\n"," As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \"Brazil, here I come\n"," Thanksss, amigo\n","\" The keeper of the reptile house was in shock\n"," \"But the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\" The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again\n"," Piers and Dudley could only gibber\n"," As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death\n"," But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \"Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?\" Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry\n"," He was so angry he could hardly speak\n"," He managed to say, \"Go cupboard stay no meals,\" before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy\n"," Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch\n"," He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet\n"," Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food\n"," He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash\n"," He couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died\n"," Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead\n"," This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from\n"," He couldn't remember his parents at all\n"," His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions\n"," There were no photographs of them in the house\n"," When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family\n"," Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him\n"," Very strange strangers they were, too\n"," A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley\n"," After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything\n"," A wildlooking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus\n"," A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word\n"," The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look\n"," At school, Harry had no one\n"," Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang\n"," The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment\n"," By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches\n"," Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang, who visited the house every single day\n"," Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader\n"," The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting\n"," This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope\n"," When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be with Dudley\n"," Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private school, Smeltings\n"," Piers Polkiss was going there too\n"," Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school\n"," Dudley thought this was very funny\n"," \"They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\" he told Harry\n"," \"Want to come upstairs and practice?\" \"No, thanks,\" said Harry\n"," \"The poor toilet's never had anything as horrible as your head down it it might be sick\n","\" Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he'd said\n"," One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs Figg's\n"," Mrs Figg wasn't as bad as usual\n"," It turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before\n"," She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she'd had it for several years\n"," That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform\n"," Smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters\n"," They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking\n"," This was supposed to be good training for later life\n"," As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life\n"," Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up\n"," Harry didn't trust himself to speak\n"," He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh\n"," There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast\n"," It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink\n"," He went to have a look\n"," The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water\n"," \"What's this?\" he asked Aunt Petunia\n"," Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question\n"," \"Your new school uniform,\" she said\n"," Harry looked in the bowl again\n"," \"Oh,\" he said, \"I didn't realize it had to be so wet\n","\" \"Don't be stupid,\" snapped Aunt Petunia\n"," \"I'm dyeing some of Dudley's old things gray for you\n"," It'll look just like everyone else's when I've finished\n","\" Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue\n"," He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably\n"," Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry's new uniform\n"," Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table\n"," They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat\n"," \"Get the mail, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper\n"," \"Make Harry get it\n","\" \"Get the mail, Harry\n","\" \"Make Dudley get it\n","\" \"Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley\n","\" Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail\n"," Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and a letter for Harry\n"," Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band\n"," No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him\n"," Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives he didn't belong to the library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back\n"," Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: Mr H\n"," Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink\n"," There was no stamp\n"," Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H\n"," \"Hurry up, boy!\" shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen\n"," \"What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?\" He chuckled at his own joke\n"," Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter\n"," He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope\n"," Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard\n"," \"Marge's ill,\" he informed Aunt Petunia\n"," \"Ate a funny whelk\n"," \" \"Dad!\" said Dudley suddenly\n"," \"Dad, Harry's got something!\" Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon\n"," \"That's mine!\" said Harry, trying to snatch it back\n"," \"Who'd be writing to you?\" sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it\n"," His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights\n"," And it didn't stop there\n"," Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge\n"," \"P-P-Petunia!\" he gasped\n"," Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach\n"," Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line\n"," For a moment it looked as though she might faint\n"," She clutched her throat and made a choking noise\n"," \"Vernon! Oh my goodness Vernon!\" They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room\n"," Dudley wasn't used to being ignored\n"," He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick\n"," \"I want to read that letter,\" he said loudly\n"," \"I want to read it,\" said Harry furiously, \"as it's mine\n","\" \"Get out, both of you,\" croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope\n"," Harry didn't move\n"," \"I WANT MY LETTER!\" he shouted\n"," \"Let me see it!\" demanded Dudley\n"," \"OUT!\" roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them\n"," Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor\n"," \"Vernon,\" Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \"look at the address how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don't think they're watching the house?\" \"Watching spying might be following us,\" muttered Uncle Vernon wildly\n"," \"But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don't want \" Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen\n"," \"No,\" he said finally\n"," \"No, we'll ignore it\n"," If they don't get an answer Yes, that's best we won't do anything \" \"But \" \"I'm not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn't we swear when we took him in we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?\" That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard\n"," \"Where's my letter?\" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door\n"," \"Who's writing to me?\" \"No one\n"," It was addressed to you by mistake,\" said Uncle Vernon shortly\n"," \"I have burned it\n","\" \"It was not a mistake,\" said Harry angrily, \"it had my cupboard on it\n","\" \"SILENCE!\" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling\n"," He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful\n"," \"Er yes, Harry about this cupboard\n"," Your aunt and I have been thinking you're really getting a bit big for it we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley's second bedroom\n"," \"Why?\" said Harry\n"," \"Don't ask questions!\" snapped his uncle\n"," \"Take this stuff upstairs, now\n","\" The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom\n"," It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room\n"," He sat down on the bed and stared around him\n"," Nearly everything in here was broken\n"," The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it\n"," Other shelves were full of books\n"," They were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched\n"," From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don't want him in there I need that room make him get out\n","\n","\n","\" Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed\n"," Yesterday he'd have given anything to be up here\n"," Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it\n"," Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet\n"," Dudley was in shock\n"," He'd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back\n"," Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the letter in the hall\n"," Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly\n"," When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it\n"," They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall\n"," Then he shouted, \"There's another one!

look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows\n"," \"Be grateful if yeh didn't mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,\" he said\n"," \"I'm er not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin'\n"," I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an' get yer letters to yeh an' stuff one o' the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job\n","\" \"Why aren't you supposed to do magic?\" asked Harry\n"," \"Oh, well I was at Hogwarts meself but I er got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth\n"," In me third year\n"," They snapped me wand in half an' everything\n"," But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper\n"," Great man, Dumbledore\n","\" \"Why were you expelled?\" \"It's gettin' late and we've got lots ter do tomorrow,\" said Hagrid loudly\n"," \"Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an' that\n","\" He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry\n"," \"You can kip under that,\" he said\n"," \"Don' mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o' doormice in one o' the pockets\n","\" Harry woke early the next morning\n"," Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight\n"," \"It was a dream, he told himself firmly\n"," \"I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards\n"," When I open my eyes I'll be at home in my cupboard\n","\" There was suddenly a loud tapping noise\n"," And there's Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking\n"," But he still didn't open his eyes\n"," It had been such a good dream\n"," Tap\n"," Tap\n"," Tap\n"," \"All right,\" Harry mumbled, \"I'm getting up\n","\" He sat up and Hagrid's heavy coat fell off him\n"," The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak\n"," Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him\n"," He went straight to the window and jerked it open\n"," The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn't wake up\n"," The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid's coat\n"," \"Don't do that\n","\" Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat\n"," \"Hagrid!\" said Harry loudly\n"," \"There's an owl \" \"Pay him,\" Hagrid grunted into the sofa\n"," \"What?\" \"He wants payin' fer deliverin' the paper\n"," Look in the pockets\n","\" Hagrid's coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags\n","\n","\n","finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins\n"," \"Give him five Knuts,\" said Hagrid sleepily\n"," \"Knuts?\" \"The little bronze ones\n","\" Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it\n"," Then he flew off through the open window\n"," Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched\n"," \"Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an' buy all yer stuff fer school\n","\" Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them\n"," He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture\n"," \"Um Hagrid?\" \"Mm?\" said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots\n"," \"I haven't got any money and you heard Uncle Vernon last night he won't pay for me to go and learn magic\n","\" \"Don't worry about that,\" said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head\n"," \"D'yeh think yer parents didn't leave yeh anything?\" \"But if their house was destroyed \" \"They didn' keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts\n"," Wizards' bank\n"," Have a sausage, they're not bad cold an' I wouldn' say no teh a bit o' yer birthday cake, neither\n","\" \"Wizards have banks?\" \"Just the one\n"," Gringotts\n"," Run by goblins\n","\" Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding\n"," \"Goblins?\" \"Yeah so yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it, I'll tell yeh that\n"," Never mess with goblins, Harry\n"," Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe cept maybe Hogwarts\n"," As a matter o' fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway\n"," Fer Dumbledore\n"," Hogwarts business\n","\" Hagrid drew himself up proudly\n"," \"He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him\n"," Fetchin' you gettin' things from Gringotts knows he can trust me, see\n","\" \"Got everythin'? Come on, then\n","\" Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock\n"," The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight\n"," The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm\n"," \"How did you get here?\" Harry asked, looking around for another boat\n"," \"Flew,\" said Hagrid\n"," \"Flew?\" \"Yeah but we'll go back in this\n"," Not s'pposed ter use magic now I've got yeh\n","\" They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying\n"," \"Seems a shame ter row, though,\" said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks\n"," \"If I was ter er speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin' it at Hogwarts?\" \"Of course not,\" said Harry, eager to see more magic\n"," Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land\n"," \"Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?\" Harry asked\n"," \"Spells enchantments,\" said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke\n"," \"They say there's dragons guardin' the high security vaults\n"," And then yeh gotta find yer way Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see\n"," Deep under the Underground\n"," Yeh'd die of hunger tryin' ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat\n","\" Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet\n"," Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he'd never had so many questions in his life\n"," \"Ministry o' Magic messin' things up as usual,\" Hagrid muttered, turning the page\n"," \"There's a Ministry of Magic?\" Harry asked, before he could stop himself\n"," \"'Course,\" said Hagrid\n"," \"They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o' course, but he'd never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job\n"," Bungler if ever there was one\n"," So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin' fer advice\n","\" \"But what does a Ministry of Magic do?\" \"Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there's still witches an' wizards up an' down the country\n","\" \"Why?\" \"Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions to their problems\n"," Nah, we're best left alone\n","\" At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall\n"," Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street\n"," Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station\n"," Harry couldn't blame them\n"," Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, \"See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?\" \"Hagrid,\" said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, \"did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?\" \"Well, so they say,\" said Hagrid\n"," \"Crikey, I'd like a dragon\n","\" \"You'd like one?\" \"Wanted one ever since I was a kid here we go\n","\" They had reached the station\n"," There was a train to London in five minutes' time\n"," Hagrid, who didn't understand \"Muggle money,\" as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets\n"," People stared more than ever on the train\n"," Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent\n"," \"Still got yer letter, Harry?\" he asked as he counted stitches\n"," Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket\n"," \"Good,\" said Hagrid\n"," \"There's a list there of everything yeh need\n","\" Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn't noticed the night before, and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL o f WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY UNIFORM First-year students will require: 1\n"," Three sets of plain work robes (black) 2\n"," One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear 3\n"," One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar) 4\n"," One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings) Please note that all pupils' clothes should carry name tags COURSE BOOKS All students should have a copy of each of the following: The Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling A Beginners' Guide to Transfiguration by Emeric Switch One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore Magical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection by Quentin Trimble OTHER EQUIPMENT 1 wand 1 cauldron (pewter, standard size 2) 1 set of glass or crystal phials 1 telescope set 1 brass scales Students may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad PARENTS ARE REMINDED THAT FIRST YEARS ARE NOT ALLOWED THEIR OWN BROOMSTICKS \"Can we buy all this in London?\" Harry wondered aloud\n"," \"If yeh know where to go,\" said Hagrid\n"," Harry had never been to London before\n"," Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way\n"," He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow\n"," \"I don't know how the Muggles manage without magic,\" he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops\n"," Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him\n"," They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand\n"," This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people\n"," Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn't known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn't help trusting him\n"," \"This is it,\" said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \"the Leaky Cauldron\n"," It's a famous place\n","\" It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub\n"," If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out, Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there\n"," The people hurrying by didn't glance at it\n"," Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at all\n"," In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it\n"," Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside\n"," For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby\n"," A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry\n"," One of them was smoking a long pipe\n"," A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut\n"," The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in\n"," Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, \"The usual, Hagrid?\" \"Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business,\" said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle\n"," \"Good Lord,\" said the bartender, peering at Harry, \"is this can this be ?\" The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent\n"," \"Bless my soul,\" whispered the old bartender, \"Harry Potter what an honor\n","\" He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes\n"," \"Welcome back, Mr Potter, welcome back\n","\" Harry didn't know what to say\n"," Everyone was looking at him\n"," The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out\n"," Hagrid was beaming\n"," Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron\n"," \"Doris Crockford, Mr Potter, can't believe I'm meeting you at last\n","\" \"So proud, Mr Potter, I'm just so proud\n","\" \"Always wanted to shake your hand I'm all of a flutter\n","\" \"Delighted, Mr Potter, just can't tell you, Diggle's the name, Dedalus Diggle\n","\" \"I've seen you before!\" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle's top hat fell off in his excitement\n"," \"You bowed to me once in a shop\n","\" \"He remembers!\" cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone\n"," \"Did you hear that? He remembers me!\" Harry shook hands again and again Doris Crockford kept coming back for more\n"," A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously\n"," One of his eyes was twitching\n"," \"Professor Quirrell!\" said Hagrid\n"," \"Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts\n","\" \"P-P-Potter,\" stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry's hand, \"ccan't t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you\n","\" \"What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\" \"D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\" muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he'd rather not think about it\n"," \"N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?\" He laughed nervously\n"," \"You'll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I've g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself\n","\" He looked terrified at the very thought\n"," But the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself\n"," It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all\n"," At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble\n"," \"Must get on lots ter buy\n"," Come on, Harry\n","\" Doris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds\n"," Hagrid grinned at Harry\n"," \"Told yeh, didn't I? Told yeh you was famous\n"," Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin' ter meet yeh mind you, he's usually tremblin'\n","\" \"Is he always that nervous?\" \"Oh, yeah\n"," Poor bloke\n"," Brilliant mind\n"," He was fine while he was studyin' outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience\n","\n","\n","\n","They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o' trouble with a hag never been the same since\n"," Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where's me umbrella?\" Vampires? Hags? Harry's head was swimming\n"," Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can\n"," \"Three up two across \" he muttered\n"," \"Right, stand back, Harry\n","\" He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella\n"," The brick he had touched quivered it wriggled in the middle, a small hole appeared it grew wider and wider a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight\n"," \"Welcome,\" said Hagrid, \"to Diagon Alley\n","\" He grinned at Harry's amazement\n"," They stepped through the archway\n"," Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall\n"," The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop\n"," Cauldrons All Sizes Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver Self-Stirring Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them\n"," \"Yeah, you'll be needin' one,\" said Hagrid, \"but we gotta get yer money first\n","\" Harry wished he had about eight more eyes\n"," He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping\n"," A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \"Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they're mad\n"," \" A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy\n"," Several boys of about Harry's age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it\n"," \"Look,\" Harry heard one of them say, \"the new Nimbus Two Thousand fastest ever \" There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon\n"," \"Gringotts,\" said Hagrid\n"," They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops\n"," Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was \"Yeah, that's a goblin,\" said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him\n"," The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry\n"," He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet\n"," He bowed as they walked inside\n"," Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: Enter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn\n"," So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there\n"," \"Like I said, Yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it,\" said Hagrid\n"," A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall\n"," About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses\n"," There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these\n"," Hagrid and Harry made for the counter\n"," \"Morning,\" said Hagrid to a free goblin\n"," \"We've come ter take some money outta Mr Harry Potter's safe\n","\" \"You have his key, sir?\" \"Got it here somewhere,\" said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin's book of numbers\n"," The goblin wrinkled his nose\n"," Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals\n"," \"Got it,\" said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key\n"," The goblin looked at it closely\n"," \"That seems to be in order\n","\" \"An' I've also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest\n"," \"It's about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen\n","\" The goblin read the letter carefully\n"," \"Very well,\" he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \"I will have someone take you down to both vaults\n"," Griphook!\" Griphook was yet another goblin\n"," Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall\n"," \"What's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\" Harry asked\n"," \"Can't tell yeh that,\" said Hagrid mysteriously\n"," \"Very secret\n"," Hogwarts business\n"," Dumbledore's trusted me\n"," More'n my job's worth ter tell yeh that\n","\" Griphook held the door open for them\n"," Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised\n"," They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches\n"," It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor\n"," Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them\n"," They climbed in Hagrid with some difficulty and were off\n"," At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages\n"," Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible\n"," The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn't steering\n"," Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open\n"," Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor\n"," \"I never know,\" Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \"what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\" \"Stalagmite's got an m' in it,\" said Hagrid\n"," \"An' don' ask me questions just now, I think I'm gonna be sick\n","\" He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling\n"," Griphook unlocked the door\n"," A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped\n"," Inside were mounds of gold coins\n"," Columns of silver\n"," Heaps of little bronze Knuts\n"," \"All yours,\" smiled Hagrid\n"," All Harry's it was incredible\n"," The Dursleys couldn't have known about this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking\n"," How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London\n"," Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag\n"," \"The gold ones are Galleons,\" he explained\n"," \"Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough\n"," Right, that should be enough fer a couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest safe for yeh\n","\" He turned to Griphook\n"," \"Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?\" \"One speed only,\" said Griphook\n"," They were going even deeper now and gathering speed\n"," The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners\n"," They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck\n"," Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole\n"," \"Stand back,\" said Griphook importantly\n"," He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away\n"," \"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through the door and trapped in there,\" said Griphook\n"," \"How often do you check to see if anyone's inside?\" Harry asked\n"," \"About once every ten years,\" said Griphook with a rather nasty grin\n"," Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least but at first he thought it was empty\n"," Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor\n"," Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat\n"," Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask\n"," \"Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don't talk to me on the way back, it's best if I keep me mouth shut,\" said Hagrid\n"," One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts\n"," Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money\n"," He didn't have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he'd had in his whole life more money than even Dudley had ever had\n"," \"Might as well get yer uniform,\" said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions\n"," \"Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts\n","\" He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin's shop alone, feeling nervous\n"," Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve\n"," \"Hogwarts, dear?\" she said, when Harry started to speak\n"," \"Got the lot here another young man being fitted up just now, in fact\n","\" In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes\n"," Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length\n"," \"Hello,\" said the boy, \"Hogwarts, too?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry\n"," \"My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street looking at wands,\" said the boy\n"," He had a bored, drawling voice\n"," \"Then I'm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms\n"," I don't see why first years can't have their own\n"," I think I'll bully father into getting me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow\n","\" Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley\n"," \"Have you got your own broom?\" the boy went on\n"," \"No,\" said Harry\n"," \"Play Quidditch at all?\" \"No,\" Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be\n"," \"I do Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree\n"," Know what house you'll be in yet?\" \"No,\" said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute\n"," \"Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?\" \"Mmm,\" said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting\n"," \"I say, look at that man!\" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window\n"," Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in\n"," \"That's Hagrid,\" said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't\n"," \"He works at Hogwarts\n","\" \"Oh,\" said the boy, \"I've heard of him\n"," He's a sort of servant, isn't he?\" \"He's the gamekeeper,\" said Harry\n"," He was liking the boy less and less every second\n"," \"Yes, exactly\n"," I heard he's a sort of savage lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed\n","\" \"I think he's brilliant,\" said Harry coldly\n"," \"Do you?\" said the boy, with a slight sneer\n"," \"Why is he with you? Where are your parents?\" \"They're dead,\" said Harry shortly\n"," He didn't feel much like going into the matter with this boy\n"," \"Oh, sorry,\" said the other, not sounding sorry at all\n"," \"But they were our kind, weren't they?\" \"They were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean\n","\" \"I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways\n"," Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine\n"," I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families\n"," What's your surname, anyway?\" But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \"That's you done, my dear,\" and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool\n"," \"Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\" said the drawling boy\n"," Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts)\n"," \"What's up?\" said Hagrid\n"," \"Nothing,\" Harry lied\n"," They stopped to buy parchment and quills\n"," Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote\n"," When they had left the shop, he said, \"Hagrid, what's Quidditch?\" \"Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin' how little yeh know not knowin' about Quidditch!\" \"Don't make me feel worse,\" said Harry\n"," He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin's\n"," \" and he said people from Muggle families shouldn't even be allowed in \" \"Yer not from a Muggle family\n"," If he'd known who yeh were he's grown up knowin' yer name if his parents are wizardin' folk\n"," You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh\n"," Anyway, what does he know about it, some o' the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in em in a long line o' Muggles look at yer mum!

Let's see it, then\n","\" She sat down\n"," Ron looked taken aback\n"," \"Er all right\n","\" He cleared his throat\n"," \"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow\n","\" He waved his wand, but nothing happened\n"," Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep\n"," \"Are you sure that's a real spell?\" said the girl\n"," \"Well, it's not very good, is it? I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me\n"," Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?\" She said all this very fast\n"," Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn't learned all the course books by heart either\n"," \"I'm Ron Weasley,\" Ron muttered\n"," \"Harry Potter,\" said Harry\n"," \"Are you really?\" said Hermione\n"," \"I know all about you, of course I got a few extra books, for background reading, and you're in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century\n","\" \"Am I?\" said Harry, feeling dazed\n"," \"Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it was me,\" said Hermione\n"," \"Do either of you know what house you'll be in?

What happened to them?\" \"Nothing, that's why it's such big news\n"," They haven't been caught\n"," My dad says it must've been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don't think they took anything, that's what's odd\n"," 'Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who's behind it\n","\" Harry turned this news over in his mind\n"," He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned\n"," He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying \"Voldemort\" without worrying\n"," \"What's your Quidditch team?\" Ron asked\n"," \"Er I don't know any\n","\" Harry confessed\n"," \"What!\" Ron looked dumbfounded\n"," \"Oh, you wait, it's the best game in the world \" And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the money\n"," He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time\n"," Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop\n"," He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he'd shown back in Diagon Alley\n"," \"Is it true?\" he said\n"," \"They're saying all down the train that Harry Potter's in this compartment\n"," So it's you, is it?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry\n"," He was looking at the other boys\n"," Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean\n"," Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards\n"," \"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\" said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking\n"," \"And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy\n","\" Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger\n"," Draco Malfoy looked at him\n"," \"Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask who you are\n"," My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford\n","\" He turned back to Harry\n"," \"You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter\n"," You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort\n"," I can help you there\n","\" He held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it\n"," \"I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\" he said coolly\n"," Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks\n"," \"I'd be careful if I were you, Potter,\" he said slowly\n"," \"Unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents\n"," They didn't know what was good for them, either\n"," You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you\n","\" Both Harry and Ron stood up\n"," \"Say that again,\" Ron said, his face as red as his hair\n"," \"Oh, you're going to fight us, are you?\" Malfoy sneered\n"," \"Unless you get out now,\" said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron\n"," \"But we don't feet like leaving, do we, boys? We've eaten all our food and you still seem to have some\n","\" Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron Ron leapt forward, but before he'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell\n"," Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle's knuckle Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once\n"," Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in\n"," \"What has been going on?\" she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail\n"," \"I think he's been knocked out,\" Ron said to Harry\n"," He looked closer at Scabbers\n"," \"No I don't believe it he's gone back to sleep\n","\" And so he had\n"," \"You've met Malfoy before?\" Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley\n"," \"I've heard of his family,\" said Ron darkly\n"," \"They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared\n"," Said they'd been bewitched\n"," My dad doesn't believe it\n"," He says Malfoy's father didn't need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side\n","\" He turned to Hermione\n"," \"Can we help you with something?\" \"You'd better hurry up and put your robes on, I've just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we're nearly there\n"," You haven't been fighting, have you?

Firs' years over here! All right there, Harry?\" Hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads\n"," \"C'mon, follow me any more firs' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs' years follow me!\" Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path\n"," It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there\n"," Nobody spoke much\n"," Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice\n"," \"Yeh'll get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec,\" Hagrid called over his shoulder, \"jus' round this bend here\n","\" There was a loud \"Oooooh!\" The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake\n"," Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers\n"," \"No more'n four to a boat!\" Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore\n"," Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione\n"," \"Everyone in?\" shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself\n"," \"Right then FORWARD!\" And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass\n"," Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead\n"," It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood\n"," \"Heads down!\" yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face\n"," They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles\n"," \"Oy, you there! Is this your toad?\" said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them\n"," \"Trevor!\" cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands\n"," Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle\n"," They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door\n"," \"Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?\" Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door\n"," The door swung open at once\n"," A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there\n"," She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross\n"," \"The firs' years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid\n"," \"Thank you, Hagrid\n"," I will take them from here\n","\" She pulled the door wide\n"," The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it\n"," The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors\n"," They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor\n"," Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall\n"," They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously\n"," \"Welcome to Hogwarts,\" said Professor McGonagall\n"," \"The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses\n"," The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts\n"," You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room\n"," \"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin\n"," Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards\n"," While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points\n"," At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor\n"," I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours\n"," \"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school\n"," I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting\n","\" Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron's smudged nose\n"," Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair\n"," \"I shall return when we are ready for you,\" said Professor McGonagall\n"," \"Please wait quietly\n","\" She left the chamber\n"," Harry swallowed\n"," \"How exactly do they sort us into houses?\" he asked Ron\n"," \"Some sort of test, I think\n"," Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking\n","\" Harry's heart gave a horrible jolt\n"," A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn't know any magic yet what on earth would he have to do? He hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived\n"," He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too\n"," No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one she'd need\n"," Harry tried hard not to listen to her\n"," He'd never been more nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue\n"," He kept his eyes fixed on the door\n"," Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom\n"," Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air several people behind him screamed\n"," \"What the ?\" He gasped\n"," So did the people around him\n"," About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall\n"," Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years\n"," They seemed to be arguing\n"," What looked like a fat little monk was saying: \"Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance \" \"My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost I say, what are you all doing here?\" A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years\n"," Nobody answered\n"," \"New students!\" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them\n"," \"About to be Sorted, I suppose?\" A few people nodded mutely\n"," \"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\" said the Friar\n"," \"My old house, you know\n","\" \"Move along now,\" said a sharp voice\n"," \"The Sorting Ceremony's about to start\n","\" Professor McGonagall had returned\n"," One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall\n"," \"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and follow me\n","\" Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall\n"," Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place\n"," It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting\n"," These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets\n"," At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting\n"," Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them\n"," The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight\n"," Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver\n"," Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars\n"," He heard Hermione whisper, \"Its bewitched to look like the sky outside\n"," I read about it in Hogwarts, A History\n","\" It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens\n"," Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years\n"," On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat\n"," This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty\n"," Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house\n"," Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too\n"," For a few seconds, there was complete silence\n"," Then the hat twitched\n"," A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the hat began to sing: \"Oh, you may not think I'm pretty, But don't judge on what you see, I'll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me\n"," You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all\n"," There's nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can't see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be\n"," You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you've a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You'll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends\n"," So put me on! Don't be afraid! And don't get in a flap! You're in safe hands (though I have none) For I'm a Thinking Cap!\" The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song\n"," It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again\n"," \"So we've just got to try on the hat!\" Ron whispered to Harry\n"," \"I'll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll\n","\" Harry\n"," smiled weakly\n"," Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching\n"," The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment\n"," If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him\n"," Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment\n"," \"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\" she said\n"," \"Abbott, Hannah!\" A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down\n"," A moments pause \"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat\n"," The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table\n"," Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her\n"," \"Bones, Susan!\" \"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah\n"," \"Boot, Terry!\" \"RAVENCLAW!\" The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them\n"," \"Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling\n"," \"Bulstrode, Millicent\" then became a Slytherin\n"," Perhaps it was Harry's imagination, after all he'd heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot\n"," He was starting to feel definitely sick now\n"," He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school\n"," He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him\n"," \"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!\" \"HUFFLEPUFF!\" Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide\n"," \"Finnigan, Seamus,\" the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor\n"," \"Granger, Hermione!\" Her mione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head\n"," \"GRYFFINDOR!\" shouted the hat\n"," Ron groaned\n"," A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous\n"," What if he wasn't chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train? When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool\n"," The hat took a long time to decide with Neville\n"," When it finally shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR,\" Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to \"MacDougal, Morag\n","\" Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, \"SLYTHERIN!\" Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself\n"," There weren't many people left now\n"," \"Moon\" , \"Nott\" , \"Parkinson\" , then a pair of twin girls, \"Patil\" and \"Patil\" , then \"Perks, Sally-Anne\" , and then, at last \"Potter, Harry!\" As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall\n"," \"Potter, did she say?\" \"The Harry Potter?\" The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him\n"," Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat\n"," He waited\n"," \"Hmm,\" said a small voice in his ear\n"," \"Difficult\n"," Very difficult\n"," Plenty of courage, I see\n"," Not a bad mind either\n"," There's talent, A my goodness, yes and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting \n","So where shall I put you?\" Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin\n"," \"Not Slytherin, eh?\" said the small voice\n"," \"Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that no? Well, if you're sure better be GRYFFINDOR!\" Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall\n"," He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table\n"," He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet\n"," Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, \"We got Potter! We got Potter!\" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier\n"," The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water\n"," He could see the High Table properly now\n"," At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up\n"," Harry grinned back\n"," And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore\n"," Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train\n"," Dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts\n"," Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron\n"," He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban\n"," And now there were only three people left to be sorted\n"," \"Thomas, Dean,\" a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table\n"," \"Turpin, Lisa,\" became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron's turn\n"," He was pale green by now\n"," Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR!\" Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him\n"," \"Well done, Ron, excellent,\" said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as \"Zabini, Blaise,\" was made a Slytherin\n"," Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away\n"," Harry looked down at his empty gold plate\n"," He had only just realized how hungry he was\n"," The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago\n"," Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet\n"," He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there\n"," \"Welcome,\" he said\n"," \"Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words\n"," And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! \"Thank you!\" He sat back down\n"," Everybody clapped and cheered\n"," Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not\n"," \"Is he a bit mad?\" he asked Percy uncertainly\n"," \"Mad?\" said Percy airily\n"," \"He's a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes\n"," Potatoes, Harry?\" Harry's mouth fell open\n"," The dishes in front of him were now piled with food\n"," He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs\n"," The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked\n"," Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick\n"," Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat\n"," It was all delicious\n"," \"That does look good,\" said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak\n"," \"Can't you ?\" \"I haven't eaten for nearly five hundred years,\" said the ghost\n"," \"I don't need to, of course, but one does miss it\n"," I don't think I've introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service\n"," Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower\n","\" \"I know who you are!\" said Ron suddenly\n"," \"My brothers told me about you you're Nearly Headless Nick!\" \"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy \" the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted\n"," \"Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\" Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wanted\n"," \"Like this,\" he said irritably\n"," He seized his left ear and pulled\n"," His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge\n"," Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly\n"," Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, \"So new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning\n"," Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable he's the Slytherin ghost\n","\" Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood\n"," He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements\n"," \"How did he get covered in blood?\" asked Seamus with great interest\n"," \"I've never asked,\" said Nearly Headless Nick delicately\n"," When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before\n"," A moment later the desserts appeared\n"," Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families\n"," \"I'm half-and-half,\" said Seamus\n"," \"Me dad's a Muggle\n"," Mom didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married\n"," Bit of a nasty shock for him\n","\" The others laughed\n"," \"What about you, Neville?\" said Ron\n"," \"Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch,\" said Neville, \"but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages\n"," My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned but nothing happened until I was eight\n"," Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go\n"," But I bounced all the way down the garden and into the road\n"," They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy\n"," And you should have seen their faces when I got in here they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see\n"," Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad\n","\" On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (\"I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult \"; \"You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing \")\n"," Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again\n"," Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet\n"," Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore\n"," Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin\n"," It happened very suddenly\n"," The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into Harry's eyes and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry's forehead\n"," \"Ouch!\" Harry clapped a hand to his head\n"," \"What is it?\" asked Percy\n"," \"N-nothing\n","\" The pain had gone as quickly as it had come\n"," Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look a feeling that he didn't like Harry at all\n"," \"Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\" he asked Percy\n"," \"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's Professor Snape\n"," He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want to everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job\n"," Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape\n","\" Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again\n"," At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again\n"," The hall fell silent\n"," \"Ahem just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered\n"," I have a few start-of-term notices to give you\n"," \"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils\n"," And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well\n","\" Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins\n"," \"I have also been asked by Mr Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors\n"," \"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term\n"," Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch\n"," \"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death\n","\" Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did\n"," \"He's not serious?\" he muttered to Percy\n"," \"Must be,\" said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore\n"," \"It's odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere the forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that\n"," I do think he might have told us prefects, at least\n","\" \"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\" cried Dumbledore\n"," Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed\n"," Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words\n"," \"Everyone pick their favorite tune,\" said Dumbledore, \"and off we go!\" And the school bellowed: \"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach us something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, Our heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now they're bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, So teach us things worth knowing, Bring back what we've forgot, just do your best, we'll do the rest, And learn until our brains all rot\n","\" Everybody finished the song at different times\n"," At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march\n"," Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest\n"," \"Ah, music,\" he said, wiping his eyes\n"," \"A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime\n"," Off you trot!\" The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase\n"," Harry's legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food\n"," He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries\n"," They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt\n"," A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him\n"," \"Peeves,\" Percy whispered to the first years\n"," \"A poltergeist\n","\" He raised his voice, \"Peeves show yourself\n","\" A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered\n"," \"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\" There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks\n"," \"Oooooooh!\" he said, with an evil cackle\n"," \"Ickle Firsties! What fun!\" He swooped suddenly at them\n"," They all ducked\n"," \"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!\" barked Percy\n"," Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville's head\n"," They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed\n"," \"You want to watch out for Peeves,\" said Percy, as they set off again\n"," \"The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even listen to us prefects\n"," Here we are\n","\" At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress\n"," \"Password?\" she said\n"," \"Caput Draconis,\" said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall\n"," They all scrambled through it Neville needed a leg up and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs\n"," Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another\n"," At the top of a spiral staircase they were obviously in one of the towers they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains\n"," Their trunks had already been brought up\n"," Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed\n"," \"Great food, isn't it?\" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings\n"," \"Get off, Scabbers! He's chewing my sheets\n","\" Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once\n"," Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream\n"," He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny\n"," Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it then Malfoy turned into the hooknosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking\n"," He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn't remember the dream at all\n"," There, look\n","\" \"Where?\" \"Next to the tall kid with the red hair\n","\" \"Wearing the glasses?\" \"Did you see his face?\" \"Did you see his scar?\" Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day\n"," People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring\n"," Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes\n"," There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump\n"," Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren't really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending\n"," It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot\n"," The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk\n"," The ghosts didn't help, either\n"," It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open\n"," Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class\n"," He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \"GOT YOUR CONK!\" Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch\n"," Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning\n"," Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor\n"," He wouldn't believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing\n"," Filch owned a cat called Mrs Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch's\n"," She patrolled the corridors alone\n"," Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she'd whisk off for Filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds later\n"," Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts\n"," The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs Norris a good kick\n"," And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves\n"," There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words\n"," They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets\n"," Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for\n"," Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost\n"," Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him\n"," Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up\n"," Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk\n"," At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight\n"," Professor McGonagall was again different\n"," Harry had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross\n"," Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class\n"," \"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\" she said\n"," \"Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back\n"," You have been warned\n","\" Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again\n"," They were all very impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized they weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time\n"," After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle\n"," By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile\n"," The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke\n"," His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he'd met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days\n"," His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story\n"," For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went\n"," Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else\n"," Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards\n"," There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start\n"," Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron\n"," They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once\n"," \"What have we got today?\" Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge\n"," \"Double Potions with the Slytherins,\" said Ron\n"," \"Snape's Head of Slytherin House\n"," They say he always favors them we'll be able to see if it's true\n","\" \"Wish McGonagall favored us,\" said Harry\n"," Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before\n"," Just then, the mail arrived\n"," Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps\n"," Hedwig hadn't brought Harry anything so far\n"," She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls\n"," This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry's plate\n"," Harry tore it open at once\n"," It said, in a very untidy scrawl: Dear Harry, I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want to hear all about your first week\n"," Send us an answer back with Hedwig\n"," Hagrid Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again\n"," It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far\n"," At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him\n"," By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong\n"," Snape didn't dislike Harry he hated him\n"," Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons\n"," It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls\n"," Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name\n"," \"Ah, Yes,\" he said softly, \"Harry Potter\n"," Our new celebrity\n","\" Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands\n"," Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class\n"," His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth\n"," They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels\n"," \"You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,\" he began\n"," He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort\n"," \"As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic\n"," I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses\n"," I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach\n","\" More silence followed this little speech\n"," Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows\n"," Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead\n"," \"Potter!\" said Snape suddenly\n"," \"What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\" Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot into the air\n"," \"I don't know, sir,\" said Harry\n"," Snape's lips curled into a sneer\n"," \"Tut, tut fame clearly isn't everything\n","\" He ignored Hermione's hand\n"," \"Let's try again\n"," Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\" Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar was\n"," He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter\n"," \"I don't know, sir\n","\" \"Thought you wouldn't open a book before coming, eh, Potter?\" Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes\n"," He had looked through his books at the Dursleys', but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi? Snape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand\n"," \"What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\" At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling\n"," \"I don't know,\" said Harry quietly\n"," \"I think Hermione does, though, why don't you try her?\" A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked\n"," Snape, however, was not pleased\n"," \"Sit down,\" he snapped at Hermione\n"," \"For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death\n"," A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons\n"," As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite\n"," Well? Why aren't you all copying that down?\" There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment\n"," Over the noise, Snape said, \"And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter\n","\" Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued\n"," Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils\n"," He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like\n"," He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon\n"," Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes\n"," Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs\n"," \"Idiot boy!\" snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand\n"," \"I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?\" Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose\n"," \"Take him up to the hospital wing,\" Snape spat at Seamus\n"," Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville\n"," \"You Potter why didn't you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another point you've lost for Gryffindor\n","\" This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron\n"," \"Don't push it,\" he muttered, \"I've heard Snape can turn very nasty\n","\" As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry's mind was racing and his spirits were low\n"," He'd lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week why did Snape hate him so much? \"Cheer up,\" said Ron, \"Snape's always taking points off Fred and George\n"," Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?\" At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds\n"," Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest\n"," A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door\n"," When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks\n"," Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, \"Back, Fang back\n","\" Hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open\n"," \"Hang on,\" he said\n"," \"Back, Fang\n","\" He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound\n"," There was only one room inside\n"," Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it\n"," \"Make yerselves at home,\" said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears\n"," Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked\n"," \"This is Ron,\" Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate\n"," \"Another Weasley, eh?\" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's freckles\n"," I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest\n","\" The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons\n"," Fang rested his head on Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes\n"," Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch \"that old git\n","\" \"An' as fer that cat, Mrs Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime\n"," D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can't get rid of her Filch puts her up to it\n","\" Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson\n"," Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students\n"," \"But he seemed to really hate me\n","\" \"Rubbish!\" said Hagrid\n"," \"Why should he?\" Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes when he said that\n"," \"How's yer brother Charlie?\" Hagrid asked Ron\n"," \"I liked him a lot great with animals\n","\" Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose\n"," While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy\n"," It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet: GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown\n"," Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken\n"," The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day\n"," \"But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what's good for you,\" said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon\n"," Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date\n"," \"Hagrid!\" said Harry, \"that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might've been happening while we were there!\" There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes this time\n"," He grunted and offered him another rock cake\n"," Harry read the story again\n"," The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day\n"," Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package\n"," Had that been what the thieves were looking for? As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid\n"," Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell Harry? Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy\n"," Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn't have to put up with Malfoy much\n"," Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan\n"," Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together\n"," \"Typical,\" said Harry darkly\n"," \"Just what I always wanted\n"," To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy\n","\" He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else\n"," \"You don't know that you'll make a fool of yourself,\" said Ron reasonably\n"," \"Anyway, I know Malfoy's always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that's all talk\n","\" Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot\n"," He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters\n"," He wasn't the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick\n"," Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom\n"," Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly\n"," Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer\n"," Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly\n"," Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move\n"," Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one\n"," Privately, Harry felt she'd had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground\n"," Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was\n"," This was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book not that she hadn't tried\n"," At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she'd gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages\n"," Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione's lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail\n"," Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course\n"," Malfoy's eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table\n"," A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother\n"," He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke\n"," \"It's a Remembrall!\" he explained\n"," \"Gran knows I forget things this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do\n"," Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red oh \" His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, \" you've forgotten something \n","\" Neville was trying to remember what he'd forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand\n"," Harry and Ron jumped to their feet\n"," They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash\n"," \"What's going on?\" \"Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor\n","\" Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table\n"," \"Just looking,\" he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him\n"," At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson\n"," It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance\n"," The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground\n"," Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left\n"," Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived\n"," She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk\n"," \"Well, what are you all waiting for?\" she barked\n"," \"Everyone stand by a broomstick\n"," Come on, hurry up\n","\" Harry glanced down at his broom\n"," It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles\n"," \"Stick out your right hand over your broom,\" called Madam Hooch at the front, \"and say Up!'\" \"UP\" everyone shouted\n"," Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did\n"," Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all\n"," Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground\n"," Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips\n"," Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years\n"," \"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\" said Madam Hooch\n"," \"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly\n"," On my whistle three two \" But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's lips\n"," \"Come back, boy!\" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle twelve feet twenty feet\n"," Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and WHAM a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap\n"," His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight\n"," Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his\n"," \"Broken wrist,\" Harry heard her mutter\n"," \"Come on, boy it's all right, up you get\n","\" She turned to the rest of the class\n"," \"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say Quidditch\n","' Come on, dear\n","\" Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him\n"," No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter\n"," \"Did you see his face, the great lump?\" The other Slytherins joined in\n"," \"Shut up, Malfoy,\" snapped Parvati Patil\n"," \"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?\" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl\n"," \"Never thought you'd like fat little crybabies, Parvati\n","\" \"Look!\" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass\n"," \"It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him\n","\" The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up\n"," \"Give that here, Malfoy,\" said Harry quietly\n"," Everyone stopped talking to watch\n"," Malfoy smiled nastily\n"," \"I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find how about up a tree?\" \"Give it here!\" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off\n"," He hadn't been lying, he could fly well\n"," Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, \"Come and get it, Potter!\" Harry grabbed his broom\n"," \"No!\" shouted Hermione Granger\n"," \"Madam Hooch told us not to move you'll get us all into trouble\n","\" Harry ignored her\n"," Blood was pounding in his ears\n"," He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being taught this was easy, this was wonderful\n"," He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron\n"," He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair\n"," Malfoy looked stunned\n"," \"Give it here,\" Harry called, \"or I'll knock you off that broom!\" \"Oh, yeah?\" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried\n"," Harry knew, somehow, what to do\n"," He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin\n"," Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady\n"," A few people below were clapping\n"," \"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\" Harry called\n"," The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy\n"," \"Catch it if you can, then!\" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground\n"," Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall\n"," He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching he stretched out his hand a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist\n"," \"HARRY POTTER!\" His heart sank faster than he'd just dived\n"," Professor McGonagall was running toward them\n"," He got to his feet, trembling\n"," \"Never in all my time at Hogwarts \" Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, \" how dare you might have broken your neck \" \"It wasn't his fault, Professor \" \"Be quiet, Miss Patil \" \"But Malfoy \" \"That's enough, Mr Weasley\n"," Potter, follow me, now\n","\" Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward the castle\n"," He was going to be expelled, he just knew it\n"," He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice\n"," Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up\n"," Now he'd done it\n"," He hadn't even lasted two weeks\n"," He'd be packing his bags in ten minutes\n"," What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep? Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn't say a word to him\n"," She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her\n"," Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore\n"," He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper\n"," Perhaps he could be Hagrid's assistant\n"," His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid's bag\n"," Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom\n"," She opened the door and poked her head inside\n"," \"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?\" Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him? But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick's class looking confused\n"," \"Follow me, you two,\" said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry\n"," \"In here\n","\" Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard\n"," \"Out, Peeves!\" she barked\n"," Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing\n"," Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys\n"," \"Potter, this is Oliver Wood\n"," Wood I've found you a Seeker\n","\" Wood's expression changed from puzzlement to delight\n"," \"Are you serious, Professor?\" \"Absolutely,\" said Professor McGonagall crisply\n"," \"The boy's a natural\n"," I've never seen anything like it\n"," Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?\" Harry nodded silently\n"," He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs\n"," \"He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,\" Professor McGonagall told Wood\n"," \"Didn't even scratch himself\n"," Charlie Weasley couldn't have done it\n","\" Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once\n"," \"Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\" he asked excitedly\n"," \"Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team,\" Professor McGonagall explained\n"," \"He's just the build for a Seeker, too,\" said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him\n"," \"Light speedy we'll have to get him a decent broom, Professor a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I'd say\n","\" \"I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the firstyear rule\n"," Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year\n"," Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape in the face for weeks\n"," \" Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry\n"," \"I want to hear you're training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you\n","\" Then she suddenly smiled\n"," \"Your father would have been proud,\" she said\n"," \"He was an excellent Quidditch player himself\n","\" \"You're joking\n","\" It was dinnertime\n"," Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall\n"," Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten all about it\n"," \"Seeker?\" he said\n"," \"But first years never you must be the youngest house player in about \" \" a century,\" said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth\n"," He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon\n"," \"Wood told me\n","\" Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry\n"," \"I start training next week,\" said Harry\n"," \"Only don't tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret\n","\" Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over\n"," \"Well done,\" said George in a low voice\n"," \"Wood told us\n"," We're on the team too Beaters\n","\" \"I tell you, we're going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,\" said Fred\n"," \"We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is going to be brilliant\n"," You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us\n","\" \"Anyway, we've got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he's found a new secret passageway out of the school\n","\" \"Bet it's that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week\n"," See you\n","\" Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle\n"," \"Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?\" \"You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got your little friends with you,\" said Harry coolly\n"," There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl\n"," \"I'd take you on anytime on my own,\" said Malfoy\n"," \"Tonight, if you want\n"," Wizard's duel\n"," Wands only no contact\n"," What's the matter? Never heard of a wizard's duel before, I suppose?\" \"Of course he has,\" said Ron, wheeling around\n"," \"I'm his second, who's yours?\" Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up\n"," \"Crabbe,\" he said\n"," \"Midnight all right? We'll meet you in the trophy room; that's always unlocked\n","\" When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other\n"," \"What is a wizard's duel?\" said Harry\n"," \"And what do you mean, you're my second?\" \"Well, a second's there to take over if you die,\" said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie\n"," Catching the look on Harry's face, he added quickly, \"But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards\n"," The most you and Malfoy'll be able to do is send sparks at each other\n"," Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage\n"," I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway\n","\" \"And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?\" \"Throw it away and punch him on the nose,\" Ron suggested\n"," \"Excuse me\n","\" They both looked up\n"," It was Hermione Granger\n"," \"Can't a person eat in peace in this place?\" said Ron\n"," Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry\n"," \"I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying \" \"Bet you could,\" Ron muttered\n"," \" and you mustn't go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you'll lose Gryffindor if you're caught, and you're bound to be\n"," It's really very selfish of you\n","\" \"And it's really none of your business,\" said Harry\n"," \"Good-bye,\" said Ron\n"," All the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn't back from the hospital wing)\n"," Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as \"If he tries to curse you, you'd better dodge it, because I can't remember how to block them\n","\" There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today\n"," On the other hand, Malfoy's sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face\n"," He couldn't miss it\n"," \"Half-past eleven,\" Ron muttered at last, \"we'd better go\n","\" They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room\n"," A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows\n"," They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, \"I can't believe you're going to do this, Harry\n","\" A lamp flickered on\n"," It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown\n"," \"You!\" said Ron furiously\n"," \"Go back to bed!\" \"I almost told your brother,\" Hermione snapped, \"Percy he's a prefect, he'd put a stop to this\n","\" Harry couldn't believe anyone could be so interfering\n"," \"Come on,\" he said to Ron\n"," He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole\n"," Hermione wasn't going to give up that easily\n"," She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose\n"," \"Don't you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don't want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you'll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells\n","\" \"Go away\n","\" \"All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you're on the train home tomorrow, you're so \" But what they were, they didn't find out\n"," Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting\n"," The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower\n"," \"Now what am I going to do?\" she asked shrilly\n"," \"That's your problem,\" said Ron\n"," \"We've got to go, we're going to be late\n","\" They hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them\n"," \"I'm coming with you,\" she said\n"," \"You are not\n","\" \"D'you think I'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I'll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up\n","\" \"You've got some nerve \" said Ron loudly\n"," \"Shut up, both of you!\" said Harry sharply\n"," I heard something\n","\" It was a sort of snuffling\n"," \"Mrs Norris?\" breathed Ron, squinting through the dark\n"," It wasn't Mrs Norris\n"," It was Neville\n"," He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer\n"," \"Thank goodness you found me! I've been out here for hours, I couldn't remember the new password to get in to bed\n","\" \"Keep your voice down, Neville\n"," The password's Pig snout' but it won't help you now, the Fat Lady's gone off somewhere\n","\" \"How's your arm?\" said Harry\n"," \"Fine,\" said Neville, showing them\n"," \"Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute\n","\" \"Good well, look, Neville, we've got to be somewhere, we'll see you later \" \"Don't leave me!\" said Neville, scrambling to his feet, \"I don't want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron's been past twice already\n","\" Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville\n"," \"If either of you get us caught, I'll never rest until I've learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you\n","\" Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward\n"," They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows\n"," At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs Norris, but they were lucky\n"," They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room\n"," Malfoy and Crabbe weren't there yet\n"," The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them\n"," Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness\n"," They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room\n"," Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once\n"," The minutes crept by\n"," \"He's late, maybe he's chickened out,\" Ron whispered\n"," Then a noise in the next room made them jump\n"," Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasn't Malfoy\n"," \"Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner\n","\" It was Filch speaking to Mrs Norris\n"," Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch's voice\n"," Neville's robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room\n"," \"They're in here somewhere,\" they heard him mutter, \"probably hiding\n","\" \"This way!\" Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor\n"," They could hear Filch getting nearer\n"," Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor\n"," The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle\n"," \"RUN!\" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room\n"," \"I think we've lost him,\" Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead\n"," Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering\n"," I told you,\" Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, \"I told you\n","\" \"We've got to get back to Gryffindor tower,\" said Ron, \"quickly as possible\n","\" \"Malfoy tricked you,\" Hermione said to Harry\n"," \"You realize that, don't you? He was never going to meet you Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off\n","\" Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to tell her that\n"," \"Let's go\n","\" It wasn't going to be that simple\n"," They hadn't gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them\n"," It was Peeves\n"," He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight\n"," \"Shut up, Peeves please you'll get us thrown out\n","\" Peeves cackled\n"," \"Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut\n"," Naughty, naughty, you'll get caughty\n","\" \"Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, please\n","\" \"Should tell Filch, I should,\" said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly\n"," \"It's for your own good, you know\n","\" \"Get out of the way,\" snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake\n"," \"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!\" Peeves bellowed, \"STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!\" Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door and it was locked\n"," \"This is it!\" Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \"We're done for! This is the end!\" They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves's shouts\n"," \"Oh, move over,\" Hermione snarled\n"," She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, \"Alohomora!\" The lock clicked and the door swung open they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening\n"," \"Which way did they go, Peeves?\" Filch was saying\n"," \"Quick, tell me\n","\" \"Say please\n","'\" \"Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\" \"Shan't say nothing if you don't say please,\" said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice\n"," \"All right please\n","\" \"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage\n"," \"He thinks this door is locked,\" Harry whispered\n"," \"I think we'll be okay get off, Neville!\" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry's bathrobe for the last minute\n"," \"What?\" Harry turned around and saw, quite clearly, what\n"," For a moment, he was sure he'd walked into a nightmare this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far\n"," They weren't in a room, as he had supposed\n"," They were in a corridor\n"," The forbidden corridor on the third floor\n"," And now they knew why it was forbidden\n"," They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor\n"," It had three heads\n"," Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs\n"," It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant\n"," Harry groped for the doorknob between Filch and death, he'd take Filch\n"," They fell backward Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor\n"," Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster\n"," They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor\n"," \"Where on earth have you all been?\" she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces\n"," \"Never mind that pig snout, pig snout,\" panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward\n"," They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs\n"," It was a while before any of them said anything\n"," Neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again\n"," \"What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?\" said Ron finally\n"," \"If any dog needs exercise, that one does\n","\" Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again\n"," \"You don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?\" she snapped\n"," \"Didn't you see what it was standing on\n"," \"The floor?\" Harry suggested\n"," \"I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads\n","\" \"No, not the floor\n"," It was standing on a trapdoor\n"," It's obviously guarding something\n","\" She stood up, glaring at them\n"," \"I hope you're pleased with yourselves\n"," We could all have been killed or worse, expelled\n"," Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed\n","\" Ron stared after her, his mouth open\n"," \"No, we don't mind,\" he said\n"," \"You'd think we dragged her along, wouldn't you\n"," But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed\n"," The dog was guarding something What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide except perhaps Hogwarts\n"," It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was\n"," Malfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful\n"," Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one\n"," In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection\n"," \"It's either really valuable or really dangerous,\" said Ron\n"," \"Or both,\" said Harry\n"," But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues\n"," Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor\n"," All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again\n"," Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus\n"," All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later\n"," As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls\n"," Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor\n"," They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel\n"," Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it said: DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE\n"," It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one\n"," Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session\n"," Professor McGonagall Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read\n"," \"A Nimbus Two Thousand!\" Ron moaned enviously\n"," \"I've never even touched one\n","\" They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle\n"," Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it\n"," \"That's a broomstick,\" he said, throwing it back to Harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face\n"," \"You'll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren't allowed them\n","\" Ron couldn't resist it\n"," \"It's not any old broomstick,\" he said, \"it's a Nimbus Two Thousand\n"," What did you say you've got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\" Ron grinned at Harry\n"," \"Comets look flashy, but they're not in the same league as the Nimbus\n","\" \"What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn't afford half the handle,\" Malfoy snapped back\n"," \"I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig\n","\" Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's elbow\n"," \"Not arguing, I hope, boys?\" he squeaked\n"," \"Potter's been sent a broomstick, Professor,\" said Malfoy quickly\n"," \"Yes, yes, that's right,\" said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry\n"," \"Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter\n"," And what model is it?\" \"A Nimbus Two Thousand, it is,\" said Harry, fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy's face\n"," \"And it's really thanks to Malfoy here that I've got it,\" he added\n"," Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy's obvious rage and confusion\n"," \"Well, it's true,\" Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, \"If he hadn't stolen Neville's Remembrall I wouldn't be on the team\n"," \" \"So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?\" came an angry voice from just behind them\n"," Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand\n"," \"I thought you weren't speaking to us?\" said Harry\n"," \"Yes, don't stop now,\" said Ron, \"it's doing us so much good\n","\" Hermione marched away with her nose in the air\n"," Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day\n"," It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night\n"," He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last\n"," \"Wow,\" Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread\n"," Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful\n"," Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top\n"," As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field\n"," Held never been inside the stadium before\n"," Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on\n"," At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end\n"," They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high\n"," Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground\n"," What a feeling he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field\n"," The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch\n"," \"Hey, Potter, come down!\" Oliver Wood had arrived\n"," He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm\n"," Harry landed next to him\n"," \"Very nice,\" said Wood, his eyes glinting\n"," \"I see what McGonagall meant you really are a natural\n"," I'm just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week\n","\" He opened the crate\n"," Inside were four different-sized balls\n"," \"Right,\" said Wood\n"," \"Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it's not too easy to play\n"," There are seven players on each side\n"," Three of them are called Chasers\n","\" \"Three Chasers,\" Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball\n"," \"This ball's called the Quaffle,\" said Wood\n"," \"The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal\n"," Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops\n"," Follow me?\" \"The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\" Harry recited\n"," \"So that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn't it?\" \"What's basketball?\" said Wood curiously\n"," \"Never mind,\" said Harry quickly\n"," \"Now, there's another player on each side who's called the Keeper I'm Keeper for Gryffindor\n"," I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring\n","\" \"Three Chasers, one Keeper,\" said Harry, who was determined to remember it all\n"," \"And they play with the Quaffle\n"," Okay, got that\n"," So what are they for?\" He pointed at the three balls left inside the box\n"," \"I'll show you now,\" said Wood\n"," \"Take this\n","\" He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat\n"," \"I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do,\" Wood said\n"," \"These two are the Bludgers\n","\" He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle\n"," Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box\n"," \"Stand back,\" Wood warned Harry\n"," He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers\n"," At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry's face\n"," Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground\n"," \"See?\" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely\n"," \"The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms\n"," That's why you have two Beaters on each team the Weasley twins are ours it's their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team\n"," So think you've got all that?\" \"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\" Harry reeled off\n"," \"Very good,\" said Wood\n"," \"Er have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\" Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand\n"," \"Never at Hogwarts\n"," We've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that\n"," Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker\n"," That's you\n"," And you don't have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers \" \" unless they crack my head open\n","\" \"Don't worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers I mean, they're like a pair of human Bludgers themselves\n","\" Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball\n"," Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut\n"," It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings\n"," \"This,\" said Wood, \"is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most important ball of the lot\n"," It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see\n"," It's the Seeker's job to catch it\n"," You've got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team's Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win\n"," That's why Seekers get fouled so much\n"," A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep\n"," \"Well, that's it any questions?\" Harry shook his head\n"," He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem\n"," \"We won't practice with the Snitch yet,\" said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, \"it's too dark, we might lose it\n"," Let's try you out with a few of these\n","\" He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch\n"," Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted\n"," After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on\n"," \"That Quidditch Cup'll have our name on it this year,\" said Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle\n"," \"I wouldn't be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons\n","\" Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two months\n"," The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had\n"," His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics\n"," On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors\n"," Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make Neville's toad zoom around the classroom\n"," Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice\n"," Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye)\n"," Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger\n"," It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this\n"," She hadn't spoken to either of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived\n"," \"Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!\" squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual\n"," \"Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick\n"," And saying the magic words properly is very important, too never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said s' instead of f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest\n","\" It was very difficult\n"," Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop\n"," Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it Harry had to put it out with his hat\n"," Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck\n"," \"Wingardium Leviosa!\" he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill\n"," \"You're saying it wrong,\" Harry heard Hermione snap\n"," \"It's Wing-gardium Levi-o-sa, make the gar' nice and long\n","\" \"You do it, then, if you're so clever,\" Ron snarled\n"," Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand, and said, \"Wingardium Leviosa!\" Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads\n"," \"Oh, well done!\" cried Professor Flitwick, clapping\n"," \"Everyone see here, Miss Granger's done it!\" Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class\n"," \"It's no wonder no one can stand her,\" he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, \"she's a nightmare, honestly\n","\" Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him\n"," It was Hermione\n"," Harry caught a glimpse of her face and was startled to see that she was in tears\n"," \"I think she heard you\n","\" \"So?\" said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable\n"," \"She must've noticed she's got no friends\n","\" Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon\n"," On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone\n"," Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds\n"," A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter\n"," The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet\n"," Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face\n"," Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, \"Troll in the dungeons thought you ought to know\n","\" He then sank to the floor in a dead faint\n"," There was an uproar\n"," It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence\n"," \"Prefects,\" he rumbled, \"lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!\" Percy was in his

Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic\n"," Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside\n"," Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint\n"," The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went\n"," \"Confuse it!\" Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap, he threw it as hard as he could against the wall\n"," The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione\n"," It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise\n"," Its mean little eyes saw Harry\n"," It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went\n"," \"Oy, pea-brain!\" yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it\n"," The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it\n"," \"Come on, run, run!\" Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror\n"," The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk\n"," It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape\n"," Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck from behind\n"," The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils\n"," Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club\n"," Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: \"Wingardium Leviosa!\" The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head\n"," The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble\n"," Harry got to his feet\n"," He was shaking and out of breath\n"," Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done\n"," It was Hermione who spoke first\n"," \"Is it dead?\" \"I don't think so,\" said Harry, I think it's just been knocked out\n","\" He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose\n"," It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue\n"," \"Urgh troll boogers\n","\" He wiped it on the troll's trousers\n"," A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up\n"," They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars\n"," A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear\n"," Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart\n"," Snape bent over the troll\n"," Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry\n"," Harry had never seen her look so angry\n"," Her lips were white\n"," Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's mind\n"," \"What on earth were you thinking of?\" said Professor McGonagall, with cold fury in her voice\n"," Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air\n"," \"You're lucky you weren't killed\n"," Why aren't you in your dormitory?\" Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look\n"," Harry looked at the floor\n"," He wished Ron would put his wand down\n"," Then a small voice came out of the shadows\n"," \"Please, Professor McGonagall they were looking for me\n","\" \"Miss Granger!\" Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last\n"," \"I went looking for the troll because I I thought I could deal with it on my own you know, because I've read all about them\n","\" Ron dropped his wand\n"," Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher? \"If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now\n"," Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club\n"," They didn't have time to come and fetch anyone\n"," It was about to finish me off when they arrived\n","\" Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them\n"," \"Well in that case \n","\n","\n","\" said Professor McGonagall, staring at the three of them, \"Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?\" Hermione hung her head\n"," Harry was speechless\n"," Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble\n"," It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets\n"," \"Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\" said Professor McGonagall\n"," \"I'm very disappointed in you\n"," If you're not hurt at all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor tower\n"," Students are finishing the feast in their houses\n","\" Hermione left\n"," Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron\n"," \"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll\n"," You each win Gryffindor five points\n"," Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this\n"," You may go\n","\" They hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had climbed two floors up\n"," It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else\n"," \"We should have gotten more than ten points,\" Ron grumbled\n"," \"Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's\n","\"

should be kept, well, secret\n"," But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know which was worse people telling him he'd be brilliant or people telling him

her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do\n"," She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read\n"," Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert\n"," Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it\n"," The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar\n"," They were standing with their backs to

Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it\n"," \"Better you than me,\" they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening\n"," He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked\n"," There was no answer\n"," He knocked again\n"," Nothing\n"," Perhaps Snape had left the book in there?

Now, listen to me, all three of yeh yer meddlin' in things that don' concern yeh\n"," It's dangerous\n"," You forget that dog, an' you forget what it's guardin', that's between Professor Dumbledore an' Nicolas Flamel \" \"Aha!\" said Harry, \"so there's someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?\" Hagrid looked furious with himself\n"," C hristmas was coming\n"," One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow\n"," The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban\n"," The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again\n"," No one could wait for the holidays to start\n"," While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms\n"," Worst of all were Professor Snape's classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons\n"," \"I do feel so sorry,\" said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, \"for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they're not wanted at home\n","\" He was looking over at Harry as he spoke\n"," Crabbe and Goyle chuckled\n"," Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them\n"," Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match\n"," Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a widemouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next\n"," Then he'd realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick\n"," So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family\n"," It was true that Harry wasn't going back to Privet Drive for Christmas\n"," Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once\n"," He didn't feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he'd ever had\n"," Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr and Mrs Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie\n"," When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead\n"," Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it\n"," \"Hi, Hagrid, want any help?\" Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches\n"," \"Nah, I'm all right, thanks, Ron\n","\" \"Would you mind moving out of the way?\" came Malfoy's cold drawl from behind them\n"," \"Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose that hut of Hagrid's must seem like a palace compared to what your family's used to\n","\" Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs\n"," \"WEASLEY!\" Ron let go of the front of Malfoy's robes\n"," \"He was provoked, Professor Snape,\" said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree\n"," \"Malfoy was insultin' his family\n","\" \"Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,\" said Snape silkily\n"," \"Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn't more\n"," Move along, all of you\n","\" Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking\n"," \"I'll get him,\" said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back, \"one of these days, I'll get him \" \"I hate them both,\" said Harry, \"Malfoy and Snape\n","\" \"Come on, cheer up, it's nearly Christmas,\" said Hagrid\n"," \"Tell yeh what, come with me an' see the Great Hall, looks a treat\n","\" So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations\n"," \"Ah, Hagrid, the last tree put it in the far corner, would you?\" The hall looked spectacular\n"," Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles\n"," \"How many days you got left until yer holidays?\" Hagrid asked\n"," \"Just one,\" said Hermione\n"," \"And that reminds me Harry, Ron, we've got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library\n","\" \"Oh yeah, you're right,\" said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree\n"," \"The library?\" said Hagrid, following them out of the hall\n"," \"Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren't yeh?\" \"Oh, we're not working,\" Harry told him brightly\n"," \"Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we've been trying to find out who he is\n","\" \"You what?\" Hagrid looked shocked\n"," \"Listen here I've told yeh drop it\n"," It's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'\n","\" \"We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all,\" said Hermione\n"," \"Unless you'd like to tell us and save us the trouble?\" Harry added\n"," \"We must've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him anywhere just give us a hint I know I've read his name somewhere\n","\" \"I'm sayin' nothin', said Hagrid flatly\n"," \"Just have to find out for ourselves, then,\" said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library\n"," They had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book\n"," He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry\n"," And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows\n"," Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random\n"," Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section\n"," He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in there\n"," Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never get one\n"," These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts\n"," \"What are you looking for, boy?\" \"Nothing,\" said Harry\n"," Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him\n"," \"You'd better get out, then\n"," Go on out!\" Wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library\n"," He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel\n"," They were sure she'd be able to tell them, but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were up to\n"," Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn't very hopeful\n"," They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising they'd found nothing\n"," What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks\n"," Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads\n"," They went off to lunch\n"," \"You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?\" said Hermione\n"," \"And send me an owl if you find anything\n","\" \"And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\" said Ron\n"," \"It'd be safe to ask them\n","\" \"Very safe, as they're both dentists,\" said Hermione\n"," Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel\n"," They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire\n"," They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork bread, English muffins, marshmallows and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn't work\n"," Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess\n"," This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle\n"," Ron's set was very old and battered\n"," Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family in this case, his grandfather\n"," However, old chessmen weren't a drawback at all\n"," Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted\n"," Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn't trust him at all\n"," He wasn't a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing\n"," \"Don't send me there, can't you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him\n","\" On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all\n"," When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed\n"," \"Merry Christmas,\" said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe\n"," \"You, too,\" said Harry\n"," \"Will you look at this? I've got some presents!\" \"What did you expect, turnips?\" said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry's\n"," Harry picked up the top parcel\n"," It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid\n"," Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute\n"," Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself\n"," Harry blew it it sounded a bit like an owl\n"," A second, very small parcel contained a note\n"," We received your message and enclose your Christmas present\n"," From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia\n"," Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece\n"," \"That's friendly,\" said Harry\n"," Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence\n"," \"Weird!\" he said, What a shape! This is money?\" \"You can keep it,\" said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was\n"," \"Hagrid and my aunt and uncle so who sent these?\" \"I think I know who that one's from,\" said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel\n"," \"My mom\n"," I told her you didn't expect any presents and oh, no,\" he groaned, \"she's made you a Weasley sweater\n","\" Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge\n"," \"Every year she makes us a sweater,\" said Ron, unwrapping his own, \"and mine's always maroon\n","\" \"That's really nice of her,\" said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty\n"," His next present also contained candy a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione\n"," This only left one parcel\n"," Harry picked it up and felt it\n"," It was very light\n"," He unwrapped it\n"," Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds\n"," Ron gasped\n"," \"I've heard of those,\" he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he'd gotten from Hermione\n"," \"If that's what I think it is they're really rare, and really valuable\n","\" \"What is it?\" Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor\n"," It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material\n"," \"It's an invisibility cloak,\" said Ron, a look of awe on his face\n"," \"I'm sure it is try it on\n","\" Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell\n"," \"It is! Look down!\" Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone\n"," He dashed to the mirror\n"," Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible\n"," He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely\n"," \"There's a note!\" said Ron suddenly\n"," \"A note fell out of it!\" Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter\n"," Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Your father left this in my possession before he died\n"," It is time it was returned to you\n"," Use it well\n"," A Very Merry Christmas to you\n"," There was no signature\n"," Harry stared at the note\n"," Ron was admiring the cloak\n"," \"I'd give anything for one of these,\" he said\n"," \"Anything\n"," What's the matter?\" \"Nothing,\" said Harry\n"," He felt very strange\n"," Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father? Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in\n"," Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight\n"," He didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else yet\n"," \"Merry Christmas!\" \"Hey, look Harry's got a Weasley sweater, too!\" Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G\n"," \"Harry's is better than ours, though,\" said Fred, holding up Harry's sweater\n"," \"She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family\n","\" \"Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?\" George demanded\n"," \"Come on, get it on, they're lovely and warm\n","\" \"I hate maroon,\" Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head\n"," \"You haven't got a letter on yours,\" George observed\n"," \"I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name\n"," But we're not stupid we know we're called Gred and Forge\n","\" \"What's all this noise?\" Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving\n"," He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized\n"," \"P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even Harry got one\n","\" \"I don't want \" said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew\n"," \"And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either,\" said George\n"," \"Christmas is a time for family\n","\" They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater\n"," Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner\n"," A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table\n"," These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside\n"," Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice\n"," Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him\n"," Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey\n"," Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice\n"," Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided\n"," When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set\n"," The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs Norris's Christmas dinner\n"," Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds\n"," Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron\n"," He suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much\n"," After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge\n"," It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever\n"," Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day\n"," Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it\n"," Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his four-poster\n"," Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it\n"," His father's this had been his father's\n"," He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air\n"," Use it well, the note had said\n"," He had to try it, now\n"," He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself\n"," Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows\n"," It was a very funny feeling\n"," Use it well\n"," Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake\n"," The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak\n"," Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence\n"," He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know\n"," Ron grunted in his sleep\n"," Should Harry wake him? Something held him back his father's cloak he felt that this time the first time he wanted to use it alone\n"," He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole\n"," \"Who's there?\" squawked the Fat Lady\n"," Harry said nothing\n"," He walked quickly down the corridor\n"," Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought\n"," And then it came to him\n"," The Restricted Section in the library\n"," He'd be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was\n"," He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked\n"," The library was pitch-black and very eerie\n"," Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books\n"," The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps\n"," The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library\n"," Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles\n"," They didn't tell him much\n"," Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn't understand\n"," Some had no title at all\n"," One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood\n"," The hairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled\n"," Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be\n"," He had to start somewhere\n"," Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book\n"," A large black and silver volume caught his eye\n"," He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open\n"," A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note\n"," He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once\n"," Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it\n"," He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears\n"," He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor\n"," He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going\n"," Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all\n"," There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there\n"," \"You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody's been in the library Restricted Section\n","\" Harry felt the blood drain out of his face\n"," Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, \"The Restricted Section? Well, they can't be far, we'll catch them\n","\" Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead\n"," They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him the cloak didn't stop him from being solid\n"," He backed away as quietly as he could\n"," A door stood ajar to his left\n"," It was his only hope\n"," He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything\n"," They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away\n"," That had been close, very close\n"," It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in\n"," It looked like an unused classroom\n"," The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way\n"," It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet\n"," There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi\n"," His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again\n"," He stepped in front of it\n"," He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming\n"," He whirled around\n"," His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him\n"," But the room was empty\n"," Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror\n"," There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others\n"," Harry looked over his shoulder but still, no one was there\n"," Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not? He looked in the mirror again\n"," A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving\n"," He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him\n"," If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air \\xe2\\x80\\x93 she and the others existed only in the mirror\n"," She was a very pretty woman\n"," She had dark red hair and her eyes her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass\n"," Bright green exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time\n"," The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her\n"," He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy\n"," It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did\n"," Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection\n"," \"Mom?\" he whispered\n"," \"Dad?\" They just looked at him, smiling\n"," And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life\n"," The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them\n"," He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness\n"," How long he stood there, he didn't know\n"," The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses\n"," He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed\n"," He tore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, \"I'll come back,\" and hurried from the room\n"," \"You could have woken me up,\" said Ron, crossly\n"," \"You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror\n"," \"I'd like to see your mom and dad,\" Ron said eagerly\n"," \"And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone\n","\" \"You can see them any old time,\" said Ron\n"," \"Just come round my house this summer\n"," Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people\n"," Shame about not finding Flamel, though\n"," Have some bacon or something, why aren't you eating anything?\" Harry couldn't eat\n"," He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight\n"," He had almost forgotten about Flamel\n"," It didn't seem very important anymore\n"," Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really? \"Are you all right?\" said Ron\n"," \"You look odd\n","\" What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again\n"," With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night\n"," They tried retracing Harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour\n"," \"I'm freezing,\" said Ron\n"," \"Let's forget it and go back\n","\" \"No!\" Harry hissed\n"," I know it's here somewhere\n","\" They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else\n"," just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor\n"," \"It's here just here yes!\" They pushed the door open\n"," Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror\n"," There they were\n"," His mother and father beamed at the sight of him\n"," \"See?\" Harry whispered\n"," \"I can't see anything\n","\" \"Look! Look at them all there are loads of them\n"," \" \"I can only see you\n","\" \"Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am\n","\" Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas\n"," Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image\n"," \"Look at me!\" he said\n"," \"Can you see all your family standing around you?\" \"No I'm alone but I'm different I look older and I'm head boy!\" \"What?\" \"I am I'm wearing the badge like Bill used to and I'm holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup I'm Quidditch captain, too\n","\" Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry\n"," \"Do you think this mirror shows the future?\" \"How can it? All my family are dead let me have another look \" \"You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time\n","\" \"You're only holding the Quidditch cup, what's interesting about that? I want to see my parents\n","\" \"Don't push me \" A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion\n"," They hadn't realized how loudly they had been talking\n"," \"Quick!\" Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs Norris came round the door\n"," Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left\n"," \"This isn't safe she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us\n"," Come on\n","\" And Ron pulled Harry out of the room\n"," The snow still hadn't melted the next morning\n"," \"Want to play chess, Harry?\" said Ron\n"," \"No\n","\" \"Why don't we go down and visit Hagrid?\" \"No you go \" \"I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror\n"," Don't go back tonight\n","\" \"Why not?\" \"I dunno, I've just got a bad feeling about it and anyway, you've had too many close shaves already\n"," Filch, Snape, and Mrs Norris are wandering around\n"," So what if they can't see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?\" \"You sound like Hermione\n","\" \"I'm serious, Harry, don't go\n","\" But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him\n"," That third night he found his way more quickly than before\n"," He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn't meet anyone\n"," And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily\n"," Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror\n"," There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family\n"," Nothing at all\n"," Except \"So back again, Harry?\" Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice\n"," He looked behind him\n"," Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore\n"," Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him\n"," \"I I didn't see you, sir\n","\" \"Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\" said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling\n"," \"So,\" said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, \"you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised\n","\" \"I didn't know it was called that, Sir\n","\" \"But I expect you've realized by now what it does?\" \"It well it shows me my family \" \"And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy\n","\" \"How did you know ?\" \"I don't need a cloak to become invisible,\" said Dumbledore gently\n"," \"Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\" Harry shook his head\n"," \"Let me explain\n"," The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is\n"," Does that help?\" Harry thought\n"," Then he said slowly, \"It shows us what we want whatever we want \" \"Yes and no,\" said Dumbledore quietly\n"," \"It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts\n"," You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you\n"," Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them\n"," However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth\n"," Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible\n"," \"The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again\n"," If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared\n"," It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that\n"," Now, why don't you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?\" Harry stood up\n"," \"Sir Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?\" \"Obviously, you've just done so,\" Dumbledore smiled\n"," \"You may ask me one more thing, however\n","\" \"What do you see when you look in the mirror?\" \"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks\n","\" Harry stared\n"," \"One can never have enough socks,\" said Dumbledore\n"," \"Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair\n"," People will insist on giving me books\n","\" It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful\n"," But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question\n"," Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk\n"," Harry wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn't\n"," He started having nightmares\n"," Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter\n"," \"You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\" said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams\n"," Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things\n"," She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\"If Filch had caught you!\"), and disappointment that he hadn't at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was\n"," They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere\n"," Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks\n"," Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again\n"," Wood was working the team harder than ever\n"," Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits\n"," The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's side\n"," If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years\n"," Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training\n"," Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news\n"," He'd just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms\n"," \"Will you stop messing around!\" he yelled\n"," \"That's exactly the sort of thing that'll lose us the match! Snape's refereeing this time, and he'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\" George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words\n"," \"Snape's refereeing?\" he spluttered through a mouthful of mud\n"," \"When's he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He's not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin\n","\" The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too\n"," \"It's not my fault,\" said Wood\n"," \"We've just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn't got an excuse to pick on us\n","\" Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch\n"," The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess\n"," Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her\n"," \"Don't talk to me for a moment,\" said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, \"I need to concen \" He caught sight of Harry's face\n"," \"What's the matter with you? You look terrible\n","\" Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape's sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee\n"," \"Don't play,\" said Hermione at once\n"," \"Say you're ill,\" said Ron\n"," \"Pretend to break your leg,\" Hermione suggested\n"," \"Really break your leg,\" said Ron\n"," \"I can't,\" said Harry\n"," \"There isn't a reserve Seeker\n"," If I back out, Gryffindor can't play at all\n","\" At that moment Neville toppled into the common room\n"," How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse\n"," He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower\n"," Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse\n"," Neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling\n"," \"What happened?\" Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron\n"," \"Malfoy,\" said Neville shakily\n"," \"I met him outside the library\n"," He said he'd been looking for someone to practice that on\n","\" \"Go to Professor McGonagall!\" Hermione urged Neville\n"," \"Report him!\" Neville shook his head\n"," \"I don't want more trouble,\" he mumbled\n"," \"You've got to stand up to him, Neville!\" said Ron\n"," \"He's used to walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier\n","\" \"There's no need to tell me I'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy's already done that,\" Neville choked out\n"," Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas\n"," He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry\n"," \"You're worth twelve of Malfoy,\" Harry said\n"," \"The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn't it? And where's Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin\n","\" Neville's lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog\n"," \"Thanks, Harry I think I'll go to bed\n"," D'you want the card, you collect them, don't you?\" As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card\n"," \"Dumbledore again,\" he said, \"He was the first one I ever \" He gasped\n"," He stared at the back of the card\n"," Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione\n"," \"I've found him!\" he whispered\n"," \"I've found Flamel! I told you I'd read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here listen to this: Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel'!\" Hermione jumped to her feet\n"," She hadn't looked so excited since they'd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework\n"," \"Stay there!\" she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls' dormitories\n"," Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms\n"," \"I never thought to look in here!\" she whispered excitedly\n"," \"I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading\n","\" \"Light?\" said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she'd looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself\n"," At last she found what she was looking for\n"," \"I knew it! I knew it!\" \"Are we allowed to speak yet?\" said Ron grumpily\n"," Hermione ignored him\n"," \"Nicolas Flamel,\" she whispered dramatically, \"is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's Stone!\" This didn't have quite the effect she'd expected\n"," \"The what?\" said Harry and Ron\n"," \"Oh, honestly, don't you two read? Look \\xe2\\x80\\x93 read that, there\n","\" She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers\n"," The stone will transform any metal into pure gold\n"," It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal\n"," There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover\n"," Mr Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixtyfifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight)\n"," \"See?\" said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished\n"," \"The dog must be guarding Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it, that's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!\" \"A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!\" said Harry\n"," \"No wonder Snape's after it! Anyone would want it\n","\" \"And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,\" said Ron\n"," \"He's not exactly recent if he's six hundred and sixty-five, is he?\" The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they'd do with a Sorcerer's Stone if they had one\n"," It wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match\n"," \"I'm going to play,\" he told Ron and Hermione\n"," \"If I don't, all the Slytherins will think I'm just too scared to face Snape\n"," I'll show them it'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win\n","\" \"Just as long as we're not wiping you off the field,\" said Hermione\n"," As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione\n"," The rest of the team wasn't too calm, either\n"," The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee? Harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went\n"," At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own\n"," Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry\n"," Could Snape possibly know they'd found out about the Sorcerer's Stone? Harry didn't see how he could yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds\n"," Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd ever see him alive again\n"," This wasn't what you'd call comforting\n"," Harry hardly heard a word of Wood's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand\n"," Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match\n"," Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse\n"," They'd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry\n"," \"Now, don't forget, it's Locomotor Mortis,\" Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve\n"," \"I know,\" Ron snapped\n"," \"Don't nag\n","\" Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside\n"," \"Don't want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it's now\n"," Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much\n","\" \"The whole school's out there!\" said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door\n"," \"Even blimey Dumbledore's come to watch!\" Harry's heart did a somersault\n"," \"Dumbledore?\" he said, dashing to the door to make sure\n"," Fred was right\n"," There was no mistaking that silver beard\n"," Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe\n"," There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching\n"," Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too\n"," \"I've never seen Snape look so mean,\" he told Hermione\n"," \"Look they're off\n"," Ouch!\" Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head\n"," It was Malfoy\n"," \"Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn't see you there\n","\" Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle\n"," \"Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?\" Ron didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him\n"," Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch\n"," \"You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?\" said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all\n"," \"It's people they feel sorry for\n"," See, there's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's the Weasleys, who've got no money you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no brains\n","\" Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy\n"," \"I'm worth twelve of you, Malfoy,\" he stammered\n"," Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, \"You tell him, Neville\n","\" \"Longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than Weasley, and that's saying something\n","\" Ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry\n"," \"I'm warning you, Malfoy one more word \" \"Ron!\" said Hermione suddenly, \"Harry \" \"What? Where?\" Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd\n"," Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet\n"," \"You're in luck, Weasley, Potter's obviously spotted some money on the ground!\" said Malfoy\n"," Ron snapped\n"," Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground\n"," Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help\n"," \"Come on, Harry!\" Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape she didn't even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle\n"," Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand\n"," The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly\n"," \"Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game's over! Harry's won! We've won! Gryffindor is in the lead!\" shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front\n"," Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground\n"," He couldn't believe it\n"," He'd done it the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes\n"," As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore's smiling face\n"," \"Well done,\" said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear\n"," \"Nice to see you haven't been brooding about that mirror\n","\n","\n","been keeping busy\n","\n","\n","excellent\n","\n","\n","\" Snape spat bitterly on the ground\n"," Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed\n"," He couldn't ever remember feeling happier\n"," He'd really done something to be proud of now \\xe2\\x80\\x93 no one could say he was just a famous name any more\n"," The evening air had never smelled so sweet\n"," He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed\n"," Harry had reached the shed\n"," He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun\n"," Gryffindor in the lead\n"," He'd done it, he'd shown Snape \n","\n","\n","\n"," And speaking of Snape A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle\n"," Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest\n"," Harry's victory faded from his mind as he watched\n"," He recognized the figure's prowling walk\n"," Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner what was going on? Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off\n"," Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run\n"," He followed\n"," The trees were so thick he couldn't see where Snape had gone\n"," He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices\n"," He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree\n"," He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves\n"," Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn't alone\n"," Quirrell was there, too\n"," Harry couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever\n"," Harry strained to catch what they were saying\n"," \" d-don't know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus \" \"Oh, I thought we'd keep this private,\" said Snape, his voice icy\n"," \"Students aren't supposed to know about the Sorcerer's Stone, after all\n","\" Harry leaned forward\n"," Quirrell was mumbling something\n"," Snape interrupted him\n"," \"Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?\" \"B-b-but Severus, I \" \"You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\" said Snape, taking a step toward him\n"," \"I-I don't know what you \" \"You know perfectly well what I mean\n","\" An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree\n"," He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, \" your little bit of hocus-pocus\n"," I'm waiting\n","\" \"B-but I d-d-don't \" \"Very well,\" Snape cut in\n"," \"We'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie\n","\" He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing\n"," It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified\n"," \"Harry, where have you been?\" Hermione squeaked\n"," \"We won! You won! We won!\" shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back\n"," \"And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed!

Get yer wands out an' practice now that's it an' if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an' we'll all come an' find yeh so, be careful let's go\n","\" The forest was black and silent\n"," A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right\n"," They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground\n"," Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves\n"," Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried\n"," \"Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?\" Harry asked\n"," \"Not fast enough,\" said Hagrid\n"," \"It's not easy ter catch a unicorn, they're powerful magic creatures\n"," I never knew one ter be hurt before\n","\" They walked past a mossy tree stump\n"," Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by\n"," There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path\n"," \"You all right, Hermione?\" Hagrid whispered\n"," \"Don' worry, it can't've gone far if it's this badly hurt, an' then we'll be able ter GET BEHIND THAT TREE!\" Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak\n"," He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire\n"," The three of them listened\n"," Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground\n"," Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away\n"," \"I knew it,\" he murmured\n"," \"There's summat in here that shouldn' be\n","\" \"A werewolf?\" Harry suggested\n"," \"That wasn' no werewolf an' it wasn' no unicorn, neither,\" said Hagrid grimly\n"," \"Right, follow me, but careful, now\n","\" They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound\n"," Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved\n"," \"Who's there?\" Hagrid called\n"," \"Show yerself I'm armed!\" And into the clearing came was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse's gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail\n"," Harry and Hermione's jaws dropped\n"," \"Oh, it's you, Ronan,\" said Hagrid in relief\n"," \"How are yeh?\" He walked forward and shook the centaur's hand\n"," \"Good evening to you, Hagrid,\" said Ronan\n"," He had a deep, sorrowful voice\n"," \"Were you going to shoot me?\" \"Can't be too careful, Ronan,\" said Hagrid, patting his crossbow\n"," \"There's summat bad loose in this forest\n"," This is Harry Potter an' Hermione Granger, by the way\n"," Students up at the school\n"," An' this is Ronan, you two\n"," He's a centaur\n"," \"We'd noticed,\" said Hermione faintly\n"," \"Good evening,\" said Ronan\n"," \"Students, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?\" \"Erm \" \"A bit,\" said Hermione timidly\n"," \"A bit\n"," Well, that's something\n","\" Ronan sighed\n"," He flung back his head and stared at the sky\n"," \"Mars is bright tonight\n","\" \"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, glancing up, too\n"," \"Listen, I'm glad we've run inter yeh, Ronan, cause there's a unicorn bin hurt you seen anythin'?\" Ronan didn't answer immediately\n"," He stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again\n"," \"Always the innocent are the first victims,\" he said\n"," \"So it has been for ages past, so it is now\n","\" \"Yeah,\" said Hagrid, \"but have yeh seen anythin' Ronan? Anythin' unusual?\" \"Mars is bright tonight,\" Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently\n"," \"Unusually bright\n","\" \"Yeah, but I was meanin' anythin' unusual a bit nearer home, said Hagrid\n"," \"So yeh haven't noticed anythin' strange?\" Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer\n"," At last, he said, \"The forest hides many secrets\n","\" A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan\n"," \"Hullo, Bane,\" said Hagrid\n"," \"All right?\" \"Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\" \"Well enough\n"," Look, I've jus' bin askin' Ronan, you seen anythin' odd in here lately? There's a unicorn bin injured would yeh know anythin' about it?\" Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan\n"," He looked skyward\n"," \"Mars is bright tonight,\" he said simply\n"," \"We've heard,\" said Hagrid grumpily\n"," \"Well, if either of you do see anythin', let me know, won't yeh? We'll be off, then\n","\" Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view\n"," \"Never,\" said Hagrid irritably, \"try an' get a straight answer out of a centaur\n"," Ruddy stargazers\n"," Not interested in anythin' closer'n the moon\n","\" \"Are there many of them in here?\" asked Hermione\n"," \"Oh, a fair few \n","Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they're good enough about turnin' up if ever I want a word\n"," They're deep, mind, centaurs they know things jus' don' let on much\n","\" \"D'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?\" said Harry\n"," \"Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what's bin killin' the unicorns \\xe2\\x80\\x93 never heard anythin' like it before\n","\" They walked on through the dense, dark trees\n"," Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder\n"," He had the nasty feeling they were being watched\n"," He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them\n"," They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid's arm\n"," \"Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!\" \"You two wait here!\" Hagrid shouted\n"," \"Stay on the path, I'll come back for yeh!\" They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn't hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them\n"," \"You don't think they've been hurt, do you?\" whispered Hermione\n"," \"I don't care if Malfoy has, but if something's got Neville it's our fault he's here in the first place\n","\" The minutes dragged by\n"," Their ears seemed sharper than usual\n"," Harry's seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig\n"," What was going on? Where were the others? At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid's return\n"," Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him\n"," Hagrid was fuming\n"," Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke\n"," Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks\n"," \"We'll be lucky ter catch anythin' now, with the racket you two were makin'\n"," Right, we're changin' groups Neville, you stay with me an' Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an' this idiot\n"," I'm sorry,\" Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, \"but he'll have a harder time frightenin' you, an' we've gotta get this done\n","\" So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang\n"," They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick\n"," Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker\n"," There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by\n"," Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak\n"," \"Look \" he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy\n"," Something bright white was gleaming on the ground\n"," They inched closer\n"," It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead\n"," Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad\n"," Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves\n"," Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood\n"," A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered\n"," Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast\n"," Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed\n"," The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal's side, and began to drink its blood\n"," \"AAAAAAAAAARGH!\" Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted so did Fang\n"," The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry unicorn blood was dribbling down its front\n"," It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry he couldn't move for fear\n"," Then a pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire\n"," Half blinded, he staggered backward\n"," He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure\n"," The pain in Harry's head was so bad he fell to his knees\n"," It took a minute or two to pass\n"," When he looked up, the figure had gone\n"," A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body\n"," \"Are you all right?\" said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet\n"," \"Yes thank you what was that?\" The centaur didn't answer\n"," He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires\n"," He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry's forehead\n"," \"You are the Potter boy,\" he said\n"," \"You had better get back to Hagrid\n"," The forest is not safe at this time especially for you\n"," Can you ride? It will be quicker this way\n"," \"My name is Firenze,\" he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back\n"," There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing\n"," Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty\n"," \"Firenze!\" Bane thundered\n"," \"What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?\" \"Do you realize who this is?\" said Firenze\n"," \"This is the Potter boy\n"," The quicker he leaves this forest, the better\n","\" \"What have you been telling him?\" growled Bane\n"," \"Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens\n"," Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?\" Ronan pawed the ground nervously\n"," \"I'm sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best, \" he said in his gloomy voice\n"," Bane kicked his back legs in anger\n"," \"For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!\" Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on\n"," \"Do you not see that unicorn?\" Firenze bellowed at Bane\n"," \"Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must\n","\" And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them\n"," Harry didn't have a clue what was going on\n"," \"Why's Bane so angry?\" he asked\n"," \"What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?\" Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry's question\n"," They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn't want to talk to him anymore\n"," They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped\n"," \"Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?\" \"No,\" said Harry, startled by the odd question\n"," \"We've only used the horn and tail hair in Potions\n","\" \"That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\" said Firenze\n"," \"Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime\n"," The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price\n"," You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips\n","\" Harry stared at the back of Firenze's head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight\n"," \"But who'd be that desperate?\" he wondered aloud\n"," \"If you're going to be cursed forever, death's better, isn't it?\" \"It is,\" Firenze agreed, \"unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else something that will bring you back to full strength and power something that will mean you can never die\n"," Mr Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?\" \"The Sorcerer's Stone! Of course the Elixir of Life! But I don't understand who \" \"Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\" It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry's heart\n"," Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: \"Some say he died\n"," Codswallop, in my opinion\n"," Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die\n","\" \"Do you mean,\" Harry croaked, \"that was Vol-\" \"Harry! Harry, are you all right?\" Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her\n"," \"I'm fine,\" said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying\n"," \"The unicorn's dead, Hagrid, it's in that clearing back there\n","\" \"This is where I leave you,\" Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn\n"," \"You are safe now\n","\" Harry slid off his back\n"," \"Good luck, Harry Potter,\" said Firenze\n"," \"The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs\n"," I hope this is one of those times\n","\" He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him\n"," Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return\n"," He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake\n"," In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest\n"," Harry couldn't sit down\n"," He paced up and down in front of the fire\n"," He was still shaking\n"," \"Snape wants the stone for Voldemort and Voldemort's waiting in the forest and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich \n","\" \"Stop saying the name!\" said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them\n"," Harry wasn't listening\n"," \"Firenze saved me, but he shouldn't have done so\n"," Bane was furious he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen \n","They must show that Voldemort's coming back\n"," Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me\n"," I suppose that's written in the stars as well\n","\" \"Will you stop saying the name!\" Ron hissed\n"," \"So all I've got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,\" Harry went on feverishly, \"then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off \n","\n","\n"," Well, I suppose Bane'll be happy\n","\" Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort\n"," \"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of with Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won't touch you\n"," Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that's a very imprecise branch of magic\n","\" The sky had turned light before they stopped talking\n"," They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore\n"," But the night's surprises weren't over\n"," When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them\n"," There was a note pinned to it: Just in case\n"," In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment\n"," Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door\n"," It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers\n"," They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anticheating spell\n"," They had practical exams as well\n"," Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk\n"," Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers\n"," Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion\n"," Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest\n"," Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it\n"," Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry\n"," The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to\n"," Their very last exam was History of Magic\n"," One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invented selfstirring cauldrons and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out\n"," When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help cheering with the rest\n"," \"That was far easier than I thought it would be,\" said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds\n"," \"I needn't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager\n","\" Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree\n"," The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows\n"," \"No more studying,\" Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass\n"," \"You could look more cheerful, Harry, we've got a week before we find out how badly we've done, there's no need to worry yet\n","\" Harry was rubbing his forehead\n"," \"I wish I knew what this means!\" he burst out angrily\n"," \"My scar keeps hurting it's happened before, but never as often as this\n","\" \"Go to Madam Pomfrey,\" Hermione suggested\n"," \"I'm not ill,\" said Harry\n"," \"I think it's a warning it means danger's coming \n","\" Ron couldn't get worked up, it was too hot\n"," \"Harry, relax, Hermione's right, the Stone's safe as long as Dumbledore's around\n"," Anyway, we've never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy\n"," He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not going to try it again in a hurry\n"," And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down\n","\" Harry nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten to do, something important\n"," When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, \"That's just the exams\n"," I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we'd done that one\n","\" Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do with work, though\n"," He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth\n"," Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters\n"," Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore\n"," Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy never but \n"," Harry suddenly jumped to his feet\n"," \"Where're you going?\" said Ron sleepily\n"," \"I've just thought of something,\" said Harry\n"," He had turned white\n"," \"We've got to go and see Hagrid, now\n","\" \"Why?\" panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up\n"," \"Don't you think it's a bit odd,\" said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, \"that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don't you think? Why didn't I see it before?\" \"What are you talking about?\" said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn't answer\n"," Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl\n"," \"Hullo,\" he said, smiling\n"," \"Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?\" \"Yes, please,\" said Ron, but Harry cut him off\n"," \"No, we're in a hurry\n"," Hagrid, I've got to ask you something\n"," You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?\" \"Dunno,\" said Hagrid casually, \"he wouldn' take his cloak off\n","\" He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows\n"," \"It's not that unusual, yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head that's the pub down in the village\n"," Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn' he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up\n","\" Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas\n"," \"What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\" \"Mighta come up,\" said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember\n"," \"Yeah he asked what I did, an' I told him I was gamekeeper here He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after so I told him an' I said what I'd always really wanted was a dragon an' then I can' remember too well, cause he kept buyin' me drinks Let's see yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an' we could play cards fer it if I wanted but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn' want it ter go ter any old home \n","So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy\n"," \" \"And did he did he seem interested in Fluffy?\" Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm\n"," \"Well yeah how many three-headed dogs d'yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy's a piece o' cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus' play him a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off ter sleep \" Hagrid suddenly looked horrified\n"," \"I shouldn'ta told yeh that!\" he blurted out\n"," \"Forget I said it! Hey where're yeh goin'?\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn't speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds\n"," \"We've got to go to Dumbledore,\" said Harry\n"," \"Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak it must've been easy, once he'd got Hagrid drunk\n"," I just hope Dumbledore believes us\n"," Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn't stop him\n"," Where's Dumbledore's office?\" They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction\n"," They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him\n"," \"We'll just have to \" Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall\n"," \"What are you three doing inside?\" It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books\n"," \"We want to see Professor Dumbledore,\" said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought\n"," \"See Professor Dumbledore?\" Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do\n"," \"Why?\" Harry swallowed now what? \"It's sort of secret,\" he said, but he wished at once he hadn't, because Professor McGonagall's nostrils flared\n"," \"Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\" she said coldly\n"," \"He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once\n","\" \"He's gone?\" said Harry frantically\n"," \"Now?\" \"Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \" \"But this is important\n","\" \"Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?\" \"Look,\" said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \"Professor it's about the Sorcerer's Stone \" Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":[" The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn't pick them up\n"," \"How do you know ?\" she spluttered\n"," \"Professor, I think I know that Sn that someone's going to try and steal the Stone\n"," I've got to talk to Professor Dumbledore\n","\" She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion\n"," \"Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\" she said finally\n"," I don't know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it's too well protected\n","\" \"But Professor \" \"Potter, I know what I'm talking about,\" she said shortly\n"," She bent down and gathered up the fallen books\n"," I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine\n","\" But they didn't\n"," \"It's tonight,\" said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot\n"," \"Snape's going through the trapdoor tonight\n"," He's found out everything he needs, and now he's got Dumbledore out of the way\n"," He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up\n","\" \"But what can we \" Hermione gasped\n"," Harry and Ron wheeled round\n"," Snape was standing there\n"," \"Good afternoon,\" he said smoothly\n"," They stared at him\n"," \"You shouldn't be inside on a day like this,\" he said, with an odd, twisted smile\n"," \"We were \" Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say\n"," \"You want to be more careful,\" said Snape\n"," \"Hanging around like this, people will think you're up to something\n"," And Gryffindor really can't afford to lose any more points, can it?\" Harry flushed\n"," They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back\n"," \"Be warned, Potter any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled\n"," Good day to you\n","\" He strode off in the direction of the staffroom\n"," Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others\n"," \"Right, here's what we've got to do,\" he whispered urgently\n"," \"One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it\n"," Hermione, you'd better do that\n","\" \"Why me?\" \"It's obvious,\" said Ron\n"," \"You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know\n","\" He put on a high voice, \" Oh Professor Flitwick, I'm so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong \n","'\" \"Oh, shut up,\" said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape\n"," \"And we'd better stay outside the third-floor corridor,\" Harry told Ron\n"," \"Come on\n","\" But that part of the plan didn't work\n"," No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper\n"," \"I suppose you think you're harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!\" she stormed\n"," \"Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you've come anywhere near here again, I'll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!\" Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, \"At least Hermione's on Snape's tail,\" when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in\n"," \"I'm sorry, Harry!\" she wailed\n"," \"Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I've only just got away, I don't know where Snape went\n","\" \"Well, that's it then, isn't it?\" Harry said\n"," The other two stared at him\n"," He was pale and his eyes were glittering\n"," \"I'm going out of here tonight and I'm going to try and get to the Stone first\n","\" \"You're mad!\" said Ron\n"," \"You can't!\" said Hermione\n"," \"After what McGonagall and Snape have said? You'll be expelled!\" \"SO WHAT\" Harry shouted\n"," \"Don't you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort's coming back! Haven't you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won't be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn't matter anymore, can't you see? D'you think he'll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I'll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it's only dying a bit later than I would have, because I'm never going over to the Dark Side! I'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\" He glared at them\n"," \"You're right Harry,\" said Hermione in a small voice\n"," \"I'll use the invisibility cloak,\" said Harry\n"," \"It's just lucky I got it back\n","\" \"But will it cover all three of us?\" said Ron\n"," \"All all three of us?\" \"Oh, come off it, you don't think we'd let you go alone?\" \"Of course not,\" said Hermione briskly\n"," \"How do you think you'd get to the Stone without us? I'd better go and took through my books, there might be something useful \n","\" \"But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too\n","\" \"Not if I can help it,\" said Hermione grimly\n"," \"Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam\n"," They're not throwing me out after that\n","\" After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room\n"," Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all\n"," This was the first night he hadn't been upset by it\n"," Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break\n"," Harry and Ron didn't talk much\n"," Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do\n"," Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed\n"," \"Better get the cloak,\" Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning\n"," Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory\n"," He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas\n"," He pocketed it to use on Fluffy he didn't feel much like singing\n"," He ran back down to the common room\n"," \"We'd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own \" \"What are you doing?\" said a voice from the corner of the room\n"," Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he'd been making another bid for freedom\n"," \"Nothing, Neville, nothing,\" said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back\n"," Neville stared at their guilty faces\n"," \"You're going out again,\" he said\n"," \"No, no, no,\" said Hermione\n"," \"No, we're not\n"," Why don't you go to bed, Neville?\" Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door\n"," They couldn't afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep\n"," \"You can't go out,\" said Neville, \"you'll be caught again\n"," Gryffindor will be in even more trouble\n","\" \"You don't understand,\" said Harry, \"this is important\n","\" But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate\n"," I won't let you do it,\" he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole\n"," \"I'll I'll fight you!\" \"Neville, \"Ron exploded, \"get away from that hole and don't be an idiot \" \"Don't you call me an idiot!\" said Neville\n"," I don't think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!\" \"Yes, but not to us,\" said Ron in exasperation\n"," \"Neville, you don't know what you're doing\n","\" He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight\n"," \"Go on then, try and hit me!\" said Neville, raising his fists\n"," \"I'm ready!\" Harry turned to Hermione\n"," \"Do something,\" he said desperately\n"," Hermione stepped forward\n"," \"Neville,\" she said, \"I'm really, really sorry about this\n","\" She raised her wand\n"," \"Petrificus Totalus!\" she cried, pointing it at Neville\n"," Neville's arms snapped to his sides\n"," His legs sprang together\n"," His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board\n"," Hermione ran to turn him over\n"," Neville's jaws were jammed together so he couldn't speak\n"," Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror\n"," \"What've you done to him?\" Harry whispered\n"," \"It's the full Body-Bind,\" said Hermione miserably\n"," \"Oh, Neville, I'm so sorry\n","\" \"We had to, Neville, no time to explain,\" said Harry\n"," \"You'll understand later, Neville,\" said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak\n"," But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very good omen\n"," In their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them\n"," At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs Norris skulking near the top\n"," \"Oh, let's kick her, just this once,\" Ron whispered in Harry's ear, but Harry shook his head\n"," As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn't do anything\n"," They didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor\n"," Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip\n"," \"Who's there?\" he said suddenly as they climbed toward him\n"," He narrowed his wicked black eyes\n"," \"Know you're there, even if I can't see you\n"," Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\" He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them\n"," \"Should call Filch, I should, if something's a-creeping around unseen\n","\" Harry had a sudden idea\n"," \"Peeves,\" he said, in a hoarse whisper, \"the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible\n","\" Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock\n"," He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs\n"," \"So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr Baron, Sir,\" he said greasily\n"," \"My mistake, my mistake I didn't see you of course I didn't, you're invisible forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir\n","\" \"I have business here, Peeves,\" croaked Harry\n"," \"Stay away from this place tonight\n","\" \"I will, sir, I most certainly will,\" said Peeves, rising up in the air again\n"," \"Hope your business goes well, Baron, I'll not bother you\n","\" And he scooted off\n"," \"Brilliant, Harry!\" whispered Ron\n"," A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor and the door was already ajar\n"," \"Well, there you are,\" Harry said quietly, \"Snape's already got past Fluffy\n","\" Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them\n"," Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two\n"," \"If you want to go back, I won't blame you,\" he said\n"," \"You can take the cloak, I won't need it now\n","\" \"Don't be stupid,\" said Ron\n"," \"We're coming,\" said Hermione\n"," Harry pushed the door open\n"," As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears\n"," All three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see them\n"," \"What's that at its feet?\" Hermione whispered\n"," \"Looks like a harp,\" said Ron\n"," \"Snape must have left it there\n","\" \"It must wake up the moment you stop playing,\" said Harry\n"," \"Well, here goes \n","\" He put Hagrid's flute to his lips and blew\n"," It wasn't really a tune, but from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop\n"," Harry hardly drew breath\n"," Slowly, the dog's growls ceased it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep\n"," \"Keep playing,\" Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor\n"," They could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads\n"," \"I think we'll be able to pull the door open,\" said Ron, peering over the dog's back\n"," \"Want to go first, Hermione?\" \"No, I don't!\" \"All right\n","\" Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's legs\n"," He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open\n"," \"What can you see?\" Hermione said anxiously\n"," \"Nothing just black there's no way of climbing down, we'll just have to drop\n","\" Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself\n"," \"You want to go first? Are you sure?\" said Ron\n"," \"I don't know how deep this thing goes\n"," Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep\n","\" Harry handed the flute over\n"," In the few seconds' silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep\n"," Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor\n"," There was no sign of the bottom\n"," He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips\n"," Then he looked up at Ron and said, \"If anything happens to me, don't follow\n"," Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?\" \"Right,\" said Ron\n"," \"See you in a minute, I hope \" And Harry let go\n"," Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and FLUMP\n"," With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft\n"," He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom\n"," It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant\n"," \"It's okay!\" he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \"it's a soft landing, you can jump!\" Ron followed right away\n"," He landed, sprawled next to Harry\n"," \"What's this stuff?\" were his first words\n"," \"Dunno, some sort of plant thing\n"," I suppose it's here to break the fall\n"," Come on, Hermione!\" The distant music stopped\n"," There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped\n"," She landed on Harry's other side\n"," \"We must be miles under the school,\" she said\n"," \"Lucky this plant thing's here, really,\" said Ron\n"," \"Lucky!\" shrieked Hermione\n"," \"Look at you both!\" She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall\n"," She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles\n"," As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing\n"," Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her\n"," Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them\n"," \"Stop moving!\" Hermione ordered them\n"," \"I know what this is it's Devil's Snare!\" \"Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help,\" snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck\n"," \"Shut up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!\" said Hermione\n"," \"Well, hurry up, I can't breathe!\" Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest\n"," \"Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare what did Professor Sprout say? it likes the dark and the damp\n","\" \"So light a fire!\" Harry choked\n"," \"Yes of course but there's no wood!\" Hermione cried, wringing her hands\n"," \"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?\" Ron bellowed\n"," \"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\" \"Oh, right!\" said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant\n"," In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth\n"," Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free\n"," \"Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\" said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face\n"," \"Yeah,\" said Ron, \"and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis there's no wood,' honestly\n","\" \"This way,\" said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward\n"," All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls\n"," The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts\n"," With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards' bank\n"," If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon Norbert had been bad enough \n"," \"Can you hear something?\" Ron whispered\n"," Harry listened\n"," A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead\n"," \"Do you think it's a ghost?\" \"I don't know sounds like wings to me\n","\" \"There's light ahead I can see something moving\n","\" They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them\n"," It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room\n"," On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door\n"," \"Do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room?\" said Ron\n"," \"Probably,\" said Harry\n"," \"They don't look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once well, there's no other choice I'll run\n","\" He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room\n"," He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened\n"," He reached the door untouched\n"," He pulled the handle, but it was locked\n"," The other two followed him\n"," They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm\n"," \"Now what?\" said Ron\n"," \"These birds they can't be here just for decoration,\" said Hermione\n"," They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering glittering? \"They're not birds!\" Harry said suddenly\n"," \"They're keys! Winged keys look carefully\n"," So that must mean \" he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys\n"," \" yes look! Broomsticks! We've got to catch the key to the door!\" \"But there are hundreds of them!\" Ron examined the lock on the door\n"," \"We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one probably silver, like the handle\n","\" They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys\n"," They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one\n"," Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century\n"," He had a knack for spotting things other people didn't\n"," After a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole\n"," \"That one!\" he called to the others\n"," \"That big one there no, there with bright blue wings the feathers are all crumpled on one side\n","\" Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom\n"," \"We've got to close in on it!\" Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing\n"," \"Ron, you come at it from above Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I'll try and catch it\n"," Right, NOW!\" Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand\n"," Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber\n"," They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand\n"," He rammed it into the lock and turned \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it worked\n"," The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice\n"," \"Ready?\" Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle\n"," They nodded\n"," He pulled the door open\n"," The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all\n"," But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight\n"," They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone\n"," Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces\n"," Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the towering white chessmen had no faces\n"," \"Now what do we do?\" Harry whispered\n"," \"It's obvious, isn't it?\" said Ron\n"," \"We've got to play our way across the room\n","\" Behind the white pieces they could see another door\n"," \"How?\" said Hermione nervously\n"," \"I think,\" said Ron, \"we're going to have to be chessmen\n","\" He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight's horse\n"," At once, the stone sprang to life\n"," The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron\n"," \"Do we er have to join you to get across?\" The black knight nodded\n"," Ron turned to the other two\n"," \"This needs thinking about \" he said\n"," \"I suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces \n","\" Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think\n"," Finally he said, \"Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess \" \"We're not offended,\" said Harry quickly\n"," \"Just tell us what to do\n","\" \"Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you next to him instead of that castle\n","\" \"What about you?\" \"I'm going to be a knight,\" said Ron\n"," The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took\n"," \"White always plays first in chess,\" said Ron, peering across the board\n"," \"Yes look \" A white pawn had moved forward two squares\n"," Ron started to direct the black pieces\n"," They moved silently wherever he sent them\n"," Harry's knees were trembling\n"," What if they lost? \"Harry move diagonally four squares to the right\n","\" Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken\n"," The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown\n"," \"Had to let that happen,\" said Ron, looking shaken\n"," \"Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on\n","\" Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy\n"," Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall\n"," Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger\n"," He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones\n"," \"We're nearly there,\" he muttered suddenly\n"," \"Let me think let me think \" The white queen turned her blank face toward him\n"," \"Yes \" said Ron softly, \"It's the only way I've got to be taken\n","\" \"NO!\" Harry and Hermione shouted\n"," \"That's chess!\" snapped Ron\n"," \"You've got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she'll take me that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!\" \"But \" \"Do you want to stop Snape or not?\" \"Ron \" \"Look, if you don't hurry up, he'll already have the Stone!\" There was no alternative\n"," \"Ready?\" Ron called, his face pale but determined\n"," \"Here I go now, don't hang around once you've won\n","\" He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced\n"," She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor Hermione screamed but stayed on her square the white queen dragged Ron to one side\n"," He looked as if he'd been knocked out\n"," Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left\n"," The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet\n"," They had won\n"," The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear\n"," With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway\n"," \"What if he's ?\" \"He'll be all right,\" said Harry, trying to convince himself\n"," \"What do you reckon's next?\" \"We've had Sprout's, that was the Devil's Snare; Flitwick must've put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell's spell, and Snape's\n","\" They had reached another door\n"," \"All right?\" Harry whispered\n"," \"Go on\n","\" Harry pushed it open\n"," A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses\n"," Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head\n"," \"I'm glad we didn't have to fight that one,\" Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs\n"," \"Come on, I can't breathe\n","\" He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line\n"," \"Snape's,\" said Harry\n"," \"What do we have to do?\" They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway\n"," It wasn't ordinary fire either; it was purple\n"," At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward\n"," They were trapped\n"," \"Look!\" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles\n"," Harry looked over her shoulder to read it: Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, Two of us will help you, which ever you would find, One among us seven will let you move ahead, Another will transport the drinker back instead, Two among our number hold only nettle wine, Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line\n"," Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: First, however slyly the poison tries to hide You will always find some on nettle wine's left side; Second, different are those who stand at either end, But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; Fourth, the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight\n"," Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing\n"," \"Brilliant,\" said Hermione\n"," \"This isn't magic it's logic a puzzle\n"," A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here forever\n","\" \"But so will we, won't we?\" \"Of course not,\" said Hermione\n"," \"Everything we need is here on this paper\n"," Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple\n","\" \"But how do we know which to drink?\" \"Give me a minute\n","\" Hermione read the paper several times\n"," Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them\n"," At last, she clapped her hands\n"," \"Got it,\" she said\n"," \"The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire toward the Stone\n","\" Harry looked at the tiny bottle\n"," \"There's only enough there for one of us,\" he said\n"," \"That's hardly one swallow\n","\" They looked at each other\n"," \"Which one will get you back through the purple flames?\" Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line\n"," \"You drink that,\" said Harry\n"," \"No, listen, get back and get Ron\n"," Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him\n"," I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I'm no match for him, really\n","\" \"But Harry what if You-Know-Who's with him?\" \"Well I was lucky once, wasn't I?\" said Harry, pointing at his scar\n"," \"I might get lucky again\n","\" Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him\n"," \"Hermione!\" \"Harry you're a great wizard, you know\n","\" \"I'm not as good as you,\" said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him\n"," \"Me!\" said Hermione\n"," \"Books! And cleverness! There are more important things friendship and bravery and oh Harry be careful!\" \"You drink first,\" said Harry\n"," \"You are sure which is which, aren't you?\" \"Positive,\" said Hermione\n"," She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered\n"," \"It's not poison?\" said Harry anxiously\n"," \"No but it's like ice\n","\" \"Quick, go, before it wears off\n","\" \"Good luck take care\n","\" \"GO!\" Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire\n"," Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle\n"," He turned to face the black flames\n"," \"Here I come,\" he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp\n"," It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body\n"," He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn't feel them for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire then he was on the other side, in the last chamber\n"," There was already someone there but it wasn't Snape\n"," It wasn't even Voldemort\n"," It was Quirrell\n"," \"You!\" gasped Harry\n"," Quirrell smiled\n"," His face wasn't twitching at all\n"," \"Me,\" he said calmly\n"," \"I wondered whether I'd be meeting you here, Potter\n","\" \"But I thought Snape \" \"Severus?\" Quirrell laughed, and it wasn't his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp\n"," \"Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn't he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat\n"," Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?\" Harry couldn't take it in\n"," This couldn't be true, it couldn't\n"," \"But Snape tried to kill me!\" \"No, no, no\n"," I tried to kill you\n"," Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match\n"," She broke my eye contact with you\n"," Another few seconds and I'd have got you off that broom\n"," I'd have managed it before then if Snape hadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you\n","\" \"Snape was trying to save me?\" \"Of course,\" said Quirrell coolly\n"," \"Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn't do it again\n"," Funny, really he needn't have bothered\n"," I couldn't do anything with Dumbledore watching\n"," All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular and what a waste of time, when after all that, I'm going to kill you tonight\n","\" Quirrell snapped his fingers\n"," Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry\n"," \"You're too nosy to live, Potter\n"," Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you'd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone\n","\" \"You let the troll in?\" \"Certainly\n"," I have a special gift with trolls you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off properly\n"," \"Now, wait quietly, Potter\n"," I need to examine this interesting mirror\n","\" It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell\n"," It was the Mirror of Erised\n"," \"This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\" Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame\n"," \"Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this but he's in London I'll be far away by the time he gets back \" All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror\n"," \"I saw you and Snape in the forest \" he blurted out\n"," \"Yes,\" said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back\n"," \"He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I'd got\n"," He suspected me all along\n"," Tried to frighten me as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side \n","\" Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it\n"," \"I see the Stone I'm presenting it to my master but where is it?\" Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn't give\n"," He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror\n"," \"But Snape always seemed to hate me so much\n","\" \"Oh, he does,\" said Quirrell casually, \"heavens, yes\n"," He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn't you know? They loathed each other\n"," But he never wanted you dead\n","\" \"But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing I thought Snape was threatening you\n"," \" For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell's face\n"," \"Sometimes,\" he said, \"I find it hard to follow my master's instructions he is a great wizard and I am weak \" \"You mean he was there in the classroom with you?\" Harry gasped\n"," \"He is with me wherever I go,\" said Quirrell quietly\n"," \"I met him when I traveled around the world\n"," A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil\n"," Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was\n"," There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times\n"," He has had to be very hard on me\n","\" Quirrell shivered suddenly\n"," \"He does not forgive mistakes easily\n"," When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased\n"," He punished me decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me\n"," \" Quirrell's voice trailed away\n"," Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley how could he have been so stupid? He'd seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron\n"," Quirrell cursed under his breath\n"," \"I don't understand is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?\" Harry's mind was racing\n"," What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does\n"," So if I look in the mirror, I should see myself finding it which means I'll see where it's hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I'm up to? He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over\n"," Quirrell ignored him\n"," He was still talking to himself\n"," \"What does this mirror do?

Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early it's not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight\n"," Mr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair\n"," Shooting stars all over Britain?\n"," Owls flying by daylight?\n"," Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place?\n"," And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters\n"," Mrs Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea\n"," It was no good\n"," He'd have to say something to her\n"," He cleared his throat nervously\n","Er Petunia, dear you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?\n"," As he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and angry\n"," After all, they normally pretended she

Dursley\n","Well, I just thought maybe it was something to do with you know her crowd\n"," Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips\n"," Mr Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name \n","Potter\n"," He decided he didn't dare\n","Their son he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?\n","I suppose so,\n","What's his name again?\n"," Howard, isn't it?\n","Harry\n"," Nasty, common name, if you ask me\n","Oh, yes,\n","Yes, I quite agree\n"," He didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed\n"," While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden\n"," The cat was still there\n"," It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something\n"," Was he imagining things?\n"," Could all this have anything to do with the Potters?\n"," If it did\n","if it got out that they were related to a pair of well, he didn't think he could bear it\n"," The Dursleys got into bed\n"," Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind\n"," His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs Dursley\n"," The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind\n","He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on he yawned and turned over it couldn't affect them\n"," How very wrong he was\n"," Mr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness\n"," It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive\n"," It didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead\n"," In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all\n"," A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground\n"," The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed\n"," Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive\n"," He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt\n"," He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots\n"," His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice\n"," This man's name was Albus Dumbledore\n"," Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome\n"," He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something\n"," But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street\n"," For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him\n"," He chuckled and muttered, \n","I should have known\n"," He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket\n"," It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter\n"," He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it\n"," The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop\n"," He clicked it again the next lamp flickered into darkness\n"," Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him\n"," If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs Dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement\n"," Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat\n"," He didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it\n","Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall\n"," He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone\n"," Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes\n"," She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one\n"," Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun\n"," She looked distinctly ruffled\n","How did you know it was me?\n","My dear Professor, I've never seen a cat sit so stiffly\n","You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting on a brick wall all day,\n","All day?\n"," When you could have been celebrating?\n"," I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here\n"," Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily\n","Oh yes, I've celebrating, all right,\n","You'd think they'd be a bit more careful, but no even the Muggles have noticed something's going on\n"," It was on their news\n"," She jerked her head back at the Dursleys' dark living-room window\n","I heard it\n"," Flocks of owls shooting stars Well, they're not completely stupid\n"," They were bound to notice something\n"," Shooting stars down in Kent I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle\n"," He never had much sense\n","You can't blame them,\n","We've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years\n","I know that,\n","But that's no reason to lose our heads\n"," People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors\n"," She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on\n","A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all\n"," I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?\n","It certainly seems so,\n","We have much to be thankful for\n"," Would you care for a lemon drop?\n","A what?\n","A lemon drop\n"," They're a kind of Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of\n","No, thank you,\n","As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone \n","My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name?\n"," All this You-Know-Who' nonsense for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort\n"," Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice\n","It all gets so confusing if we keep saying You-KnowWho\n","' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort's name\n","But you're different\n"," Everyone knows you're the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of\n","You flatter me,\n","Voldemort had powers I will never have\n","Only because you're too well noble to use them\n","It's lucky it's dark\n"," I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs\n","The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around\n"," You know what they're saying?\n"," About why he's disappeared?\n"," About what finally stopped him?\n"," It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now\n"," It was plain that whatever \n","everyone\n"," was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true\n"," Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer\n","What they're saying,\n"," she pressed on, \n","is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric's Hollow\n"," He went to find the Potters\n"," The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are are that they're dead\n"," Dumbledore bowed his head\n"," Professor McGonagall gasped\n","Lily and James I can't believe it I didn't want to believe it Oh, Albus \n"," Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder\n","I know I know \n"," Professor McGonagall's voice trembled as she went on\n","That's not all\n"," They're saying he tried to kill the Potter's son, Harry\n"," But he couldn't\n"," He couldn't kill that little boy\n"," No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow broke and that's why he's gone\n"," Dumbledore nodded glumly\n","It's it's true?\n"," faltered Professor McGonagall\n","After all he's done all the people he's killed he couldn't kill a little boy?\n"," It's just astounding of all the things to stop him but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?\n","We can only guess\n","We may never know\n"," Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles\n"," Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it\n"," It was a very odd watch\n"," It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge\n","Hagrid's late\n"," I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here, by the way?\n","Yes,\n","And I don't suppose you're going to tell me why you're here, of all places?\n","I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle\n"," They're the only family he has left now\n","You don't mean \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you can't mean the people who live here?\n"," cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four\n","Dumbledore you can't\n"," I've been watching them all day\n"," You couldn't find two people who are less like us\n"," And they've got this son I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets\n"," Harry Potter come and live here!\n","It's the best place for him,\n","His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he's older\n"," I've written them a letter\n","A letter?\n"," repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall\n","Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter?\n"," These people will never understand him! He'll be famous a legend I wouldn't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future there will be books written about Harry every child in our world will know his name!\n","Exactly\n","It would be enough to turn any boy's head\n"," Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won't even remember! Can you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?\n","Yes yes, you're right, of course\n"," But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?\n"," She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it\n","Hagrid's bringing him\n","You think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?\n","I would trust Hagrid with my life,\n","I'm not saying his heart isn't in the right place,\n","but you can't pretend he's not careless\n"," He does tend to what was that?\n"," A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them\n"," It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them\n"," If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it\n"," He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide\n"," He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins\n"," In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets\n","Hagrid,\n","At last\n"," And where did you get that motorcycle?\n","Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\n","Young Sirius Black lent it to me\n"," I've got him, sir\n","No problems, were there?\n","No, sir house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin' around\n"," He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol\n"," Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets\n"," Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep\n"," Under a tuft of jetblack hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning\n","Is that where ?\n","Yes,\n","He'll have that scar forever\n","Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?\n","Even if I could, I wouldn't\n"," Scars can come in handy\n"," I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground\n"," Well give him here, Hagrid we'd better get this over with\n"," Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys' house\n","Could I could I say good-bye to him, sir?\n"," He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss\n"," Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog\n","Shhh!\n"," hissed Professor McGonagall, \n","You'll wake the Muggles!\n","S-s-sorry,\n"," sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it\n","But I c-c-can't stand it Lily an' James dead an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles \n","Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be found,\n"," He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two\n"," For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out\n","Well,\n","that's that\n"," We've no business staying here\n"," We may as well go and join the celebrations\n","Yeah,\n","I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back\n"," G'night, Professor McGonagall Professor Dumbledore, sir\n"," Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night\n","I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\n"," Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply\n"," Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street\n"," On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer\n"," He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street\n"," He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four\n","Good luck, Harry,\n"," he murmured\n"," He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone\n"," A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen\n"," Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up\n"," One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours' time by Mrs Dursley's scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley\n","He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: \n","To Harry Potter the boy who lived!\n"," In early ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all\n"," The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls\n"," Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed\n"," Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother\n"," The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too\n"," Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long\n"," His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day\n","Up! Get up! Now!\n"," Harry woke with a start\n"," His aunt rapped on the door again\n","Up!\n"," she screeched\n"," Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove\n"," He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having\n"," It had been a good one\n"," There had been a flying motorcycle in it\n"," He had a funny feeling he'd had the same dream before\n"," His aunt was back outside the door\n","Are you up yet?\n"," she demanded\n","Nearly,\n","Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon\n"," And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday\n"," Harry groaned\n","What did you say?\n"," his aunt snapped through the door\n","Nothing, nothing \n"," Dudley's birthday how could he have forgotten?\n"," Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks\n"," He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on\n"," Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept\n"," When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen\n"," The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents\n"," It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike\n"," Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise unless of course it involved punching somebody\n"," Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him\n"," Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast\n"," Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age\n"," He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was\n"," Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes\n"," He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose\n"," The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning\n"," He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it\n","In the car crash when your parents died,\n","And don't ask questions\n"," Don't ask questions that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys\n"," Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon\n","Comb your hair!\n"," he barked, by way of a morning greeting\n"," About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut\n"," Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way all over the place\n"," Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother\n"," Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon\n"," He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head\n"," Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn't much room\n"," Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents\n"," His face fell\n","Thirty-six,\n","That's two less than last year\n","Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here under this big one from Mummy and Daddy\n","All right, thirty-seven then,\n"," Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over\n","And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today\n"," How's that, popkin?\n"," Two more presents\n"," Is that all right\n"," Dudley thought for a moment\n"," It looked like hard work\n","So I'll have thirty\n","thirty\n","Thirty-nine, sweetums,\n","Oh\n"," Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel\n","All right then\n"," Uncle Vernon chuckled\n","Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father\n"," 'Atta boy, Dudley!\n"," He ruffled Dudley's hair\n"," At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR\n"," He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried\n","Bad news, Vernon,\n","Mrs Figg's broken her leg\n"," She can't take him\n"," She jerked her head in Harry's direction\n"," Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart gave a leap\n"," Every year on Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies\n"," Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away\n"," Harry hated it there\n"," The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she'd ever owned\n","Now what?\n"," Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr Paws, and Tufty again\n","We could phone Marge,\n"," Uncle Vernon suggested\n","Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy\n"," The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't there or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like a slug\n","What about what's-her-name, your friend Yvonne?\n","On vacation in Majorca,\n"," snapped Aunt Petunia\n","You could just leave me here,\n"," Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley's computer)\n"," Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon\n","And come back and find the house in ruins?\n"," she snarled\n","I won't blow up the house,\n","I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\n"," and leave him in the car\n","That car's new, he's not sitting in it alone\n"," Dudley began to cry loudly\n"," In fact, he wasn't really crying it had been years since he'd really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted\n","Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!\n"," she cried, flinging her arms around him\n","I don't want him t-t-to come!\n"," Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs\n","He always sp-spoils everything!\n"," He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother's arms\n"," Just then, the doorbell rang \n","Oh, good Lord, they're here!\n"," Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat\n"," He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them\n"," Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once\n"," Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life\n"," His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside\n","I'm warning you,\n","I'm warning you now, boy any funny business, anything at all and you'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas\n","I'm not going to do anything,\n","honestly \n"," But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him\n"," No one ever did\n"," The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn't make them happen\n"," Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \n","to hide that horrible scar\n"," Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses\n"," Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly\n"," Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls)\n"," The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry\n"," Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished\n"," On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens\n"," Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney\n"," The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings\n"," But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors\n"," Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump\n"," But today, nothing was going to go wrong\n"," It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or Mrs Figg's cabbage-smelling living room\n"," While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia\n"," He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects\n"," This morning, it was motorcycles\n"," roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\n","I had a dream about a motorcycle,\n","It was flying\n"," Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front\n"," He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \n","MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!\n"," Dudley and Piers sniggered\n","I know they don't,\n","It was only a dream\n"," If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas\n"," It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families\n"," It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn't blond\n"," Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time\n"," He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him\n"," They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first\n"," Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last\n"," After lunch they went to the reptile house\n"," It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls\n"," Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone\n"," Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons\n"," Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place\n"," It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can but at the moment it didn't look in the mood\n"," In fact, it was fast asleep\n"," Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils\n","Make it move,\n"," he whined at his father\n"," Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn't budge\n","Do it again,\n"," Dudley ordered\n"," Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on\n","This is boring,\n"," Dudley moaned\n"," He shuffled away\n"," Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake\n"," He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long\n"," It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house\n"," The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes\n"," Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry's\n"," It winked\n"," Harry stared\n"," Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching\n"," They weren't\n"," He looked back at the snake and winked, too\n"," The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling\n","I get that all the time\n","I know,\n"," Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him\n","It must be really annoying\n"," The snake nodded vigorously\n","Where do you come from, anyway?\n"," The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass\n"," Harry peered at it\n"," Boa Constrictor, Brazil\n","Was it nice there?\n"," The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo\n","Oh, I see so you've never been to Brazil?\n"," As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump\n","DUDLEY! Mr DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT IT'S DOING!\n"," Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could\n","Out of the way, you,\n"," Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor\n"," What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror\n"," Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished\n"," The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor\n"," People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits\n","Brazil, here I come\n"," Thanksss, amigo\n"," The keeper of the reptile house was in shock\n","But the glass,\n"," he kept saying, \n","where did the glass go?\n"," The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again\n"," Piers and Dudley could only gibber\n"," As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death\n"," But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \n","Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?\n"," Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry\n"," He was so angry he could hardly speak\n"," He managed to say, \n","Go cupboard stay no meals,\n"," before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy\n"," Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch\n"," He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet\n"," Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food\n"," He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash\n"," He couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died\n"," Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead\n"," This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from\n"," He couldn't remember his parents at all\n"," His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions\n"," There were no photographs of them in the house\n"," When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family\n"," Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him\n"," Very strange strangers they were, too\n"," A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley\n"," After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything\n"," A wildlooking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus\n"," A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word\n"," The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look\n"," At school, Harry had no one\n"," Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang\n"," The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment\n"," By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches\n"," Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang, who visited the house every single day\n"," Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader\n"," The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting\n"," This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope\n"," When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be with Dudley\n"," Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon's old private school, Smeltings\n"," Piers Polkiss was going there too\n"," Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school\n"," Dudley thought this was very funny\n","They stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,\n"," he told Harry\n","Want to come upstairs and practice?\n","No, thanks,\n","The poor toilet's never had anything as horrible as your head down it it might be sick\n"," One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs Figg's\n"," Mrs Figg wasn't as bad as usual\n"," It turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before\n"," She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she'd had it for several years\n"," That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform\n"," Smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters\n"," They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking\n"," This was supposed to be good training for later life\n"," Harry didn't trust himself to speak\n"," He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh\n"," There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast\n"," It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink\n"," He went to have a look\n"," The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water\n","What's this?\n"," Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question\n","Your new school uniform,\n"," Harry looked in the bowl again\n","Oh,\n","I didn't realize it had to be so wet\n","Don't be stupid,\n"," snapped Aunt Petunia\n","I'm dyeing some of Dudley's old things gray for you\n"," It'll look just like everyone else's when I've finished\n"," Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue\n"," He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably\n"," Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry's new uniform\n"," Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table\n"," They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat\n","Get the mail, Dudley,\n","Make Harry get it\n","Get the mail, Harry\n","Make Dudley get it\n","Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley\n"," Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail\n"," Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and a letter for Harry\n"," Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band\n"," No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him\n"," Who would?\n"," He had no friends, no other relatives he didn't belong to the library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back\n"," Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: Mr H\n"," Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink\n"," There was no stamp\n"," Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H\n","Hurry up, boy!\n"," shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen\n","What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?\n"," He chuckled at his own joke\n"," Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter\n"," He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope\n"," Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard\n","Marge's ill,\n"," he informed Aunt Petunia\n","Ate a funny whelk\n","Dad!\n","Dad, Harry's got something!\n"," Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon\n","That's mine!\n","Who'd be writing to you?\n"," sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it\n"," His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights\n"," And it didn't stop there\n"," Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge\n","P-P-Petunia!\n"," he gasped\n"," Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach\n"," Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line\n"," For a moment it looked as though she might faint\n"," She clutched her throat and made a choking noise\n","Vernon! Oh my goodness Vernon!\n"," They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room\n"," Dudley wasn't used to being ignored\n"," He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick\n","I want to read that letter,\n","I want to read it,\n","as it's mine\n","Get out, both of you,\n"," croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope\n"," Harry didn't move\n","I WANT MY LETTER!\n"," he shouted\n","Let me see it!\n"," demanded Dudley\n","OUT!\n"," roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them\n"," Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor\n","Vernon,\n"," Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \n","look at the address how could they possibly know where he sleeps?\n"," You don't think they're watching the house?\n","Watching spying might be following us,\n"," muttered Uncle Vernon wildly\n","But what should we do, Vernon?\n"," Should we write back?\n"," Tell them we don't want \n"," Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen\n","No,\n","No, we'll ignore it\n"," If they don't get an answer Yes, that's best we won't do anything \n","But \n","I'm not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn't we swear when we took him in we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?\n"," That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard\n","Where's my letter?\n","Who's writing to me?\n","No one\n"," It was addressed to you by mistake,\n","I have burned it\n","It was not a mistake,\n","it had my cupboard on it\n","SILENCE!\n"," yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling\n"," He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful\n","Er yes, Harry about this cupboard\n"," Your aunt and I have been thinking you're really getting a bit big for it we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley's second bedroom\n","Why?\n","Don't ask questions!\n"," snapped his uncle\n","Take this stuff upstairs, now\n"," The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn't fit into his first bedroom\n"," It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room\n"," He sat down on the bed and stared around him\n"," Nearly everything in here was broken\n"," The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor's dog; in the corner was Dudley's first-ever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it\n"," Other shelves were full of books\n"," They were the only things in the room that looked as though they'd never been touched\n"," From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don't want him in there I need that room make him get out\n"," Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed\n"," Yesterday he'd have given anything to be up here\n"," Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it\n"," Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet\n"," Dudley was in shock\n"," He'd screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back\n"," Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened the letter in the hall\n"," Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly\n"," When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it\n"," They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall\n"," Then he shouted, \n","There's another one!

Yer mad\n"," His name's been down ever since he was born\n"," He's off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world\n"," Seven years there and he won't know himself\n"," He'll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an' he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled \n","I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!\n"," yelled Uncle Vernon\n"," But he had finally gone too far\n"," Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, \n","NEVER \n"," he thundered, \n"," INSULT ALBUS DUMBLEDORE IN FRONT OF ME!\n"," He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain\n"," When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig's tail poking through a hole in his trousers\n"," Uncle Vernon roared\n"," Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them\n"," Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard\n","Shouldn'ta lost me temper,\n","but it didn't work anyway\n"," Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn't much left ter do\n"," He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows\n","Be grateful if yeh didn't mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,\n","I'm er not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin'\n"," I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an' get yer letters to yeh an' stuff one o' the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job\n","Why aren't you supposed to do magic?\n","Oh, well I was at Hogwarts meself but I er got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth\n"," In me third year\n"," They snapped me wand in half an' everything\n"," But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper\n"," Great man, Dumbledore\n","Why were you expelled?\n","It's gettin' late and we've got lots ter do tomorrow,\n","Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an' that\n"," He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry\n","You can kip under that,\n","Don' mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o' doormice in one o' the pockets\n"," Harry woke early the next morning\n"," Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight\n","It was a dream, he told himself firmly\n","I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards\n"," When I open my eyes I'll be at home in my cupboard\n"," There was suddenly a loud tapping noise\n"," And there's Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking\n"," But he still didn't open his eyes\n"," It had been such a good dream\n"," Tap\n"," Tap\n"," Tap\n","All right,\n"," Harry mumbled, \n","I'm getting up\n"," He sat up and Hagrid's heavy coat fell off him\n"," The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak\n"," Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him\n"," He went straight to the window and jerked it open\n"," The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn't wake up\n"," The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid's coat\n","Don't do that\n"," Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat\n","Hagrid!\n","There's an owl \n","Pay him,\n"," Hagrid grunted into the sofa\n","What?\n","He wants payin' fer deliverin' the paper\n"," Look in the pockets\n"," Hagrid's coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags\n","finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins\n","Give him five Knuts,\n","Knuts?\n","The little bronze ones\n"," Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it\n"," Then he flew off through the open window\n"," Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched\n","Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an' buy all yer stuff fer school\n"," Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them\n"," He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture\n","Um Hagrid?\n","Mm?\n","I haven't got any money and you heard Uncle Vernon last night he won't pay for me to go and learn magic\n","Don't worry about that,\n","D'yeh think yer parents didn't leave yeh anything?\n","But if their house was destroyed \n","They didn' keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts\n"," Wizards' bank\n"," Have a sausage, they're not bad cold an' I wouldn' say no teh a bit o' yer birthday cake, neither\n","Wizards have banks?\n","Just the one\n"," Gringotts\n"," Run by goblins\n"," Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding\n","Goblins?\n","Yeah so yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it, I'll tell yeh that\n"," Never mess with goblins, Harry\n"," Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe cept maybe Hogwarts\n"," As a matter o' fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway\n"," Fer Dumbledore\n"," Hogwarts business\n"," Hagrid drew himself up proudly\n","He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him\n"," Fetchin' you gettin' things from Gringotts knows he can trust me, see\n","Got everythin'?\n"," Come on, then\n"," Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock\n"," The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight\n"," The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm\n","How did you get here?\n","Flew,\n","Flew?\n","Yeah but we'll go back in this\n"," Not s'pposed ter use magic now I've got yeh\n"," They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying\n","Seems a shame ter row, though,\n","If I was ter er speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin' it at Hogwarts?\n","Of course not,\n"," Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land\n","Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?\n","Spells enchantments,\n","They say there's dragons guardin' the high security vaults\n"," And then yeh gotta find yer way Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see\n"," Deep under the Underground\n"," Yeh'd die of hunger tryin' ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat\n"," Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet\n"," Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he'd never had so many questions in his life\n","Ministry o' Magic messin' things up as usual,\n"," Hagrid muttered, turning the page\n","There's a Ministry of Magic?\n","'Course,\n","They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o' course, but he'd never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job\n"," Bungler if ever there was one\n"," So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin' fer advice\n","But what does a Ministry of Magic do?\n","Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there's still witches an' wizards up an' down the country\n","Why?\n","Why?\n"," Blimey, Harry, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions to their problems\n"," Nah, we're best left alone\n"," At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall\n"," Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street\n"," Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station\n"," Harry couldn't blame them\n"," Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, \n","See that, Harry?\n"," Things these Muggles dream up, eh?\n","Hagrid,\n","did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?\n","Well, so they say,\n","Crikey, I'd like a dragon\n","You'd like one?\n","Wanted one ever since I was a kid here we go\n"," They had reached the station\n"," There was a train to London in five minutes' time\n"," Hagrid, who didn't understand \n","Muggle money,\n"," as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets\n"," People stared more than ever on the train\n"," Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent\n","Still got yer letter, Harry?\n"," Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket\n","Good,\n","There's a list there of everything yeh need\n"," Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn't noticed the night before, and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL o f WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY UNIFORM First-year students will require: 1\n"," Three sets of plain work robes (black) 2\n"," One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear 3\n"," One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar) 4\n"," One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings) Please note that all pupils'

London?\n"," Harry wondered aloud\n","If yeh know where to go,\n"," Harry had never been to London before\n"," Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way\n"," He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow\n","I don't know how the Muggles manage without magic,\n"," Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him\n"," They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand\n"," This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people\n"," Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them?\n"," Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks?\n"," Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up?\n"," If Harry hadn't known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn't help trusting him\n","This is it,\n","the Leaky Cauldron\n"," It's a famous place\n"," It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub\n"," If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out, Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there\n"," The people hurrying by didn't glance at it\n"," Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at all\n"," In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it\n"," Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside\n"," For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby\n"," A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry\n"," One of them was smoking a long pipe\n"," A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut\n"," The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in\n"," Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, \n","The usual, Hagrid?\n","Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business,\n","Good Lord,\n","is this can this be ?\n"," The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent\n","Bless my soul,\n","Harry Potter what an honor\n"," He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes\n","Welcome back, Mr Potter, welcome back\n"," Harry didn't know what to say\n"," Everyone was looking at him\n"," The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out\n"," Hagrid was beaming\n"," Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron\n","Doris Crockford, Mr Potter, can't believe I'm meeting you at last\n","So proud, Mr Potter, I'm just so proud\n","Always wanted to shake your hand I'm all of a flutter\n","Delighted, Mr Potter, just can't tell you, Diggle's the name, Dedalus Diggle\n","I've seen you before!\n","You bowed to me once in a shop\n","He remembers!\n"," cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone\n","Did you hear that?\n"," He remembers me!\n"," Harry shook hands again and again Doris Crockford kept coming back for more\n"," A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously\n"," One of his eyes was twitching\n","Professor Quirrell!\n","Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts\n","P-P-Potter,\n"," stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry's hand, \n","ccan't t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you\n","What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\n","D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\n"," muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he'd rather not think about it\n","N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?\n"," He laughed nervously\n","You'll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose?\n"," I've g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself\n"," He looked terrified at the very thought\n"," But the others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself\n"," It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all\n"," At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble\n","Must get on lots ter buy\n"," Come on, Harry\n"," Doris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds\n"," Hagrid grinned at Harry\n","Told yeh, didn't I?\n"," Told yeh you was famous\n"," Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin' ter meet yeh mind you, he's usually tremblin'\n","Is he always that nervous?\n","Oh, yeah\n"," Poor bloke\n"," Brilliant mind\n"," He was fine while he was studyin' outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience\n","They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o' trouble with a hag never been the same since\n"," Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where's me umbrella?\n"," Vampires?\n"," Hags?\n"," Harry's head was swimming\n"," Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can\n","Three up two across \n"," he muttered\n","Right, stand back, Harry\n"," He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella\n"," The brick he had touched quivered it wriggled in the middle, a small hole appeared it grew wider and wider a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight\n","Welcome,\n","to Diagon Alley\n"," He grinned at Harry's amazement\n"," They stepped through the archway\n"," Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall\n"," The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop\n","Yeah, you'll be needin' one,\n","but we gotta get yer money first\n"," Harry wished he had about eight more eyes\n"," He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping\n"," A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, \n","Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they're mad\n"," A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy\n"," Several boys of about Harry's age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it\n","Look,\n"," Harry heard one of them say, \n","the new Nimbus Two Thousand fastest ever \n"," There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels' eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon\n","Gringotts,\n"," They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops\n"," Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was \n","Yeah, that's a goblin,\n"," The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry\n"," He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet\n"," He bowed as they walked inside\n"," Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: Enter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn\n"," So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours, Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there\n"," A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall\n"," About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses\n"," There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these\n"," Hagrid and Harry made for the counter\n","Morning,\n","We've come ter take some money outta Mr Harry Potter's safe\n","You have his key, sir?\n","Got it here somewhere,\n"," The goblin wrinkled his nose\n"," Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals\n","Got it,\n"," The goblin looked at it closely\n","That seems to be in order\n","An' I've also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\n","It's about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen\n"," The goblin read the letter carefully\n","Very well,\n","I will have someone take you down to both vaults\n"," Griphook!\n"," Griphook was yet another goblin\n"," Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall\n","What's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?\n","Can't tell yeh that,\n","Very secret\n"," Hogwarts business\n"," Dumbledore's trusted me\n"," More'n my job's worth ter tell yeh that\n"," Griphook held the door open for them\n"," Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised\n"," They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches\n"," It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor\n"," Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them\n"," They climbed in Hagrid with some difficulty and were off\n"," At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages\n"," Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible\n"," The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn't steering\n"," Harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open\n"," Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor\n","I never know,\n"," Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \n","what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\n","Stalagmite's got an m' in it,\n","An' don' ask me questions just now, I think I'm gonna be sick\n"," He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling\n"," Griphook unlocked the door\n"," A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped\n"," Inside were mounds of gold coins\n"," Columns of silver\n"," Heaps of little bronze Knuts\n","All yours,\n"," smiled Hagrid\n"," All Harry's it was incredible\n"," The Dursleys couldn't have known about this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking\n"," How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep?\n"," And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London\n"," Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag\n","The gold ones are Galleons,\n"," he explained\n","Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough\n"," Right, that should be enough fer a couple o' terms, we'll keep the rest safe for yeh\n"," He turned to Griphook\n","Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?\n","One speed only,\n"," They were going even deeper now and gathering speed\n"," The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners\n"," They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck\n"," Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole\n","Stand back,\n"," He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away\n","If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through the door and trapped in there,\n","How often do you check to see if anyone's inside?\n","About once every ten years,\n"," Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least but at first he thought it was empty\n"," Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor\n"," Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat\n"," Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask\n","Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don't talk to me on the way back, it's best if I keep me mouth shut,\n"," One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts\n"," Harry didn't know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money\n"," He didn't have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he'd had in his whole life more money than even Dudley had ever had\n","Might as well get yer uniform,\n","Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron?\n"," I hate them Gringotts carts\n"," He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin's shop alone, feeling nervous\n"," Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve\n","Hogwarts, dear?\n","Got the lot here another young man being fitted up just now, in fact\n"," In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes\n"," Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length\n","Hello,\n","Hogwarts, too?\n","Yes,\n","My father's next door buying my books and mother's up the street looking at wands,\n"," He had a bored, drawling voice\n","Then I'm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms\n"," I don't see why first years can't have their own\n"," I think I'll bully father into getting me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow\n"," Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley\n","Have you got your own broom?\n"," the boy went on\n","No,\n","Play Quidditch at all?\n","No,\n","I do Father says it's a crime if I'm not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree\n"," Know what house you'll be in yet?\n","No,\n","Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I'll be in Slytherin, all our family have been imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?\n","Mmm,\n","I say, look at that man!\n"," Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in\n","That's Hagrid,\n","He works at Hogwarts\n","Oh,\n","I've heard of him\n"," He's a sort of servant, isn't he?\n","He's the gamekeeper,\n"," He was liking the boy less and less every second\n","Yes, exactly\n"," I heard he's a sort of savage lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed\n","I think he's brilliant,\n","Do you?\n","Why is he with you?\n"," Where are your parents?\n","They're dead,\n"," He didn't feel much like going into the matter with this boy\n","Oh, sorry,\n","But they were our kind, weren't they?\n","They were a witch and wizard, if that's what you mean\n","I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you?\n"," They're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways\n"," Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine\n"," I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families\n"," What's your surname, anyway?\n","That's you done, my dear,\n"," and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool\n","Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\n"," Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts)\n","What's up?\n","Nothing,\n"," Harry lied\n"," They stopped to buy parchment and quills\n"," Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote\n","Hagrid, what's Quidditch?\n","Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin' how little yeh know not knowin' about Quidditch!\n","Don't make me feel worse,\n"," He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin's\n","Yer not from a Muggle family\n"," If he'd known who yeh were he's grown up knowin' yer name if his parents are wizardin' folk\n"," You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh\n"," Anyway, what does he know about it, some o' the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in em in a long line o' Muggles look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!\n","So what is Quidditch?\n","It's our sport\n"," Wizard sport\n"," It's like like soccer in the Muggle world everyone follows Quidditch played up in the air on broomsticks and there's four balls sorta hard ter explain the rules\n","And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?\n","School houses\n"," There's four\n"," Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o' duffers, but \n","I bet I'm in Hufflepuff,\n","Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\n","There's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin\n"," You-Know-Who was one\n","Vol-, sorry You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\n","Years an' years ago,\n"," They bought Harry's school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all\n"," Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these\n"," Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian\n","I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley\n","I'm not sayin' that's not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,\n","An' anyway, yeh couldn' work any of them curses yet, yeh'll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level\n"," Hagrid wouldn't let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\n","It says pewter on yer list\n","), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope\n"," Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages\n"," Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling\n"," Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry's list again\n","Just yer wand left A yeah, an' I still haven't got yeh a birthday present\n"," Harry felt himself go red\n","You don't have to \n","I know I don't have to\n"," Tell yeh what, I'll get yer animal\n"," Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh'd be laughed at an' I don' like cats, they make me sneeze\n"," I'll get yer an owl\n"," All the kids want owls, they're dead useful, carry yer mail an' everythin'\n"," Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes\n"," Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing\n"," He couldn't stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell\n","Don' mention it,\n","Don' expect you've had a lotta presents from them Dursleys\n"," Just Ollivanders left now only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand\n"," A magic wand this was what Harry had been really looking forward to\n"," The last shop was narrow and shabby\n"," Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B\n","C\n"," A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window\n"," A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside\n"," It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait\n"," Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling\n"," For some reason, the back of his neck prickled\n"," The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic\n","Good afternoon,\n"," Harry jumped\n"," Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair\n"," An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop\n","Hello,\n","Ah yes,\n","Yes, yes\n"," I thought I'd be seeing you soon\n"," Harry Potter\n"," It wasn't a question\n","You have your mother's eyes\n"," It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand\n"," Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow\n"," Nice wand for charm work\n"," Mr Ollivander moved closer to Harry\n"," Harry wished he would blink\n"," Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy\n","Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand\n"," Eleven inches\n"," Pliable\n"," A little more power and excellent for transfiguration\n"," Well, I say your father favored it it's really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course\n"," Mr Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose\n"," Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes\n","And that's where \n"," Mr Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry's forehead with a long, white finger\n","I'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\n","Thirteenand-a-half inches\n"," Yew\n"," Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands well, if I'd known what that wand was going out into the world to do\n"," He shook his head and then, to Harry's relief, spotted Hagrid\n","Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again\n"," Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn't it?\n","It was, sir, yes,\n","Good wand, that one\n"," But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?\n","Er yes, they did, yes,\n","I've still got the pieces, though,\n"," he added brightly\n","But you don't use them?\n","Oh, no, sir,\n"," Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke\n","Hmmm,\n","Well, now Mr Potter\n"," Let me see\n"," He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket\n","Which is your wand arm?\n","Er well, I'm right-handed,\n","Hold out your arm\n"," That's it\n"," He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head\n","Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr Potter\n"," We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons\n"," No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same\n"," And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard's wand\n"," Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own\n"," Mr Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes\n","That will do,\n","Right then, Mr Potter\n"," Try this one\n"," Beechwood and dragon heartstring\n"," Nine inches\n"," Nice and flexible\n"," just take it and give it a wave\n"," Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once\n","Maple and phoenix feather\n"," Seven inches\n"," Quite whippy\n"," Try \n"," Harry tried but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr Ollivander\n","No, no here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy\n"," Go on, go on, try it out\n"," Harry tried\n"," And tried\n"," He had no idea what Mr Ollivander was waiting for\n"," The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become\n","Tricky customer, eh?\n"," Not to worry, we'll find the perfect match here somewhere I wonder, now yes, why not unusual combination holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple\n"," Harry took the wand\n"," He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers\n"," He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls\n"," Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr Ollivander cried, \n","Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good\n"," Well, well, well how curious how very curious \n"," He put Harry's wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, \n","Curious curious \n","Sorry,\n","but what's curious?\n"," Mr Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare\n","I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr Potter\n"," Every single wand\n"," It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather just one other\n"," It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why, its brother gave you that scar\n"," Harry swallowed\n","Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches\n"," Yew\n"," Curious indeed how these things happen\n"," The wand chooses the wizard, remember I think we must expect great things from you, Mr Potter \n","After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things terrible, yes, but great\n"," Harry shivered\n"," He wasn't sure he liked Mr Ollivander too much\n"," He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr Ollivander bowed them from his shop\n"," The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty\n"," Harry didn't speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn't even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry's lap\n"," Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder\n","Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\n"," He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them\n"," Harry kept looking around\n"," Everything looked so strange, somehow\n","You all right, Harry?\n"," Yer very quiet,\n"," Harry wasn't sure he could explain\n"," He'd just had the best birthday of his life and yet he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words\n","Everyone thinks I'm special,\n","All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr Ollivander but I don't know anything about magic at all\n"," How can they expect great things?\n"," I'm famous and I can't even remember what I'm famous for\n"," I don't know what happened when Vol-, sorry I mean, the night my parents died\n"," Hagrid leaned across the table\n"," Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile\n","Don' you worry, Harry\n"," You'll learn fast enough\n"," Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you'll be just fine\n"," Just be yerself\n"," I know it's hard\n"," Yeh've been singled out, an' that's always hard\n"," But yeh'll have a great time at Hogwarts I did still do, 'smatter of fact\n"," Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope\n","Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, \n","First o' September King's Cross it's all on yer ticket\n"," Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she'll know where to find me \n","See yeh soon, Harry\n"," The train pulled out of the station\n"," Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone\n"," Harry's last month with the Dursleys wasn't fun\n"," True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn't stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him in fact, they didn't speak to him at all\n"," Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty\n"," Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while\n"," Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company\n"," He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic\n"," His school books were very interesting\n"," He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased\n"," It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice\n"," Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first\n"," On the last day of August he thought he'd better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King's Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television\n"," He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room\n","Er Uncle Vernon?\n"," Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening\n","Er I need to be at King's Cross tomorrow to to go to Hogwarts\n"," Uncle Vernon grunted again\n","Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?\n"," Grunt\n"," Harry supposed that meant yes\n","Thank you\n"," He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke\n","Funny way to get to a wizards' school, the train\n"," Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?\n"," Harry didn't say anything\n","Where is this school, anyway?\n","I don't know,\n"," He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket\n","I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o'clock,\n"," he read\n"," His aunt and uncle stared\n","Platform what?\n","Nine and three-quarters\n","Don't talk rubbish,\n","There is no platform nine and three-quarters\n","It's on my ticket\n","Barking,\n","howling mad, the lot of them\n"," You'll see\n"," You just wait\n"," All right, we'll take you to King's Cross\n"," We're going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn't bother\n","Why are you going to London?\n","Taking Dudley to the hospital,\n"," growled Uncle Vernon\n","Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings\n"," Harry woke at five o'clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep\n"," He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn't want to walk into the station in his wizard's robes he'd change on the train\n"," He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up\n"," Two hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off\n"," They reached King's Cross at half past ten\n"," Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him\n"," Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face\n","Well, there you are, boy\n"," Platform nine platform ten\n"," Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don't seem to have built it yet, do they?\n"," He was quite right, of course\n"," There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all\n","Have a good term,\n"," He left without another word\n"," Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away\n"," All three of them were laughing\n"," Harry's mouth went rather dry\n"," What on earth was he going to do?\n"," He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig\n"," He'd have to ask someone\n"," He stopped a passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and three-quarters\n"," The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn't even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose\n"," In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters\n"," Harry was now trying hard not to panic\n"," According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl\n"," Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley\n"," He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten\n"," At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying\n"," packed with Muggles, of course \n"," Harry swung round\n"," The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair\n"," Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry's in front of him and they had an owl\n"," Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them\n"," They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying\n","Now, what's the platform number?\n","Nine and three-quarters!\n"," piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was holding her hand, \n","Mom, can't I go \n","You're not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet\n"," All right, Percy, you go first\n"," What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten\n"," Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished\n","Fred, you next,\n","I'm not Fred, I'm George,\n","Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother?\n"," Can't you tell I'm George?\n","Sorry, George, dear\n","Only joking, I am Fred,\n"," His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone but how had he done it?\n"," Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there and then, quite suddenly, he wasn't anywhere\n"," There was nothing else for it\n","Excuse me,\n","Hello, dear,\n","First time at Hogwarts?\n"," Ron's new, too\n"," She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons\n"," He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose\n","Yes,\n","The thing is the thing is, I don't know how to \n","How to get onto the platform?\n","Not to worry,\n","All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten\n"," Don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into it, that's very important\n"," Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous\n"," Go on, go now before Ron\n","Er okay,\n"," He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier\n"," It looked very solid\n"," He started to walk toward it\n"," People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten\n"," Harry walked more quickly\n"," He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he'd be in trouble leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run the barrier was coming nearer and nearer he wouldn't be able to stop the cart was out of control he was a foot away he closed his eyes ready for the crash It didn't come he kept on running he opened his eyes\n"," A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people\n"," Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it\n"," Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs\n"," Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks\n"," The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats\n"," Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat\n"," He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, \n","Gran, I've lost my toad again\n","Oh, Neville,\n"," he heard the old woman sigh\n"," A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd\n","Give us a look, Lee, go on\n"," The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg\n"," Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train\n"," He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door\n"," He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot\n","Want a hand?\n"," It was one of the red-haired twins he'd followed through the barrier\n","Yes, please,\n"," Harry panted\n","Oy, Fred! C'mere and help!\n"," With the twins' help, Harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment\n","Thanks,\n","What's that?\n","Blimey,\n","Are you ?\n","He is,\n","Aren't you?\n"," he added to Harry\n","What?\n","Harry Potter\n"," chorused the twins\n","Oh, him,\n","I mean, yes, I am\n"," The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red\n"," Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train's open door\n","Fred?\n"," George?\n"," Are you there?\n","Coming, Mom\n"," With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train\n"," Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying\n"," Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief\n","Ron, you've got something on your nose\n"," The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose\n","Mom geroff\n"," He wriggled free\n","Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?\n","Shut up,\n","Where's Percy?\n","He's coming now\n"," The oldest boy came striding into sight\n"," He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it\n","Can't stay long, Mother,\n","I'm up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves \n","Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?\n","Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,\n","Once \n","Or twice \n","A minute \n","All summer \n","Oh, shut up,\n","How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?\n","Because he's a prefect,\n","All right, dear, well, have a good term send me an owl when you get there\n"," She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left\n"," Then she turned to the twins\n","Now, you two this year, you behave yourselves\n"," If I get one more owl telling me you've you've blown up a toilet or \n","Blown up a toilet?\n"," We've never blown up a toilet\n","Great idea though, thanks, Mom\n","It's not funny\n"," And look after Ron\n","Don't worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us\n","Shut up,\n"," He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it\n","Hey, Mom, guess what?\n"," Guess who we just met on the train?\n"," Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn't see him looking\n","You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station?\n"," Know who he is?\n","Who?\n","Harry Potter!\n"," Harry heard the little girl's voice\n","Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please\n","You've already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn't something you goggle at in a zoo\n"," Is he really, Fred?\n"," How do you know?\n","Asked him\n"," Saw his scar\n"," It's really there like lightning\n","Poor dear no wonder he was alone, I wondered\n","Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?\n"," Their mother suddenly became very stern\n","I forbid you to ask him, Fred\n"," No, don't you dare\n"," As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school\n","All right, keep your hair on\n"," A whistle sounded\n","Hurry up!\n"," They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry\n","Don't, Ginny, we'll send you loads of owls\n","We'll send you a Hogwarts' toilet seat\n","George!\n","Only joking, Mom\n"," The train began to move\n"," Harry saw the boys' mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved\n"," Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner\n"," Houses flashed past the window\n"," Harry felt a great leap of excitement\n"," He didn't know what he was going to but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind\n"," The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in\n","Anyone sitting there?\n","Everywhere else is full\n"," Harry shook his head and the boy sat down\n"," He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn't looked\n"," Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose\n","Hey, Ron\n"," The twins were back\n","Listen, we're going down the middle of the train Lee Jordan's got a giant tarantula down there\n","Right,\n"," mumbled Ron\n","Harry,\n","did we introduce ourselves?\n"," Fred and George Weasley\n"," And this is Ron, our brother\n"," See you later, then\n","Bye,\n"," The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them\n","Are you really Harry Potter?\n"," Ron blurted out\n"," Harry nodded\n","Oh well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George's jokes,\n","And have you really got you know \n"," He pointed at Harry's forehead\n"," Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar\n"," Ron stared\n","So that's where You-Know-Who ?\n","Yes,\n","but I can't remember it\n","Nothing?\n","Well I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else\n","Wow,\n"," He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again\n","Are all your family wizards?\n","Er Yes, I think so,\n","I think Mom's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him\n","So you must know loads of magic already\n"," The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about\n","I heard you went to live with Muggles,\n","What are they like?\n","Horrible well, not all of them\n"," My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though\n"," Wish I'd had three wizard brothers\n","Five,\n"," For some reason, he was looking gloomy\n","I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts\n"," You could say I've got a lot to live up to\n"," Bill and Charlie have already left Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch\n"," Now Percy's a prefect\n"," Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny\n"," Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first\n"," You never get anything new, either, with five brothers\n"," I've got Bill's old robes, Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat\n"," Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep\n","His name's Scabbers and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up\n"," Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn't aff I mean, I got Scabbers instead\n"," Ron's ears went pink\n"," Harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl\n"," After all, he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents\n"," This seemed to cheer Ron up\n"," and until Hagrid told me, I didn't know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort \n"," Ron gasped\n","What?\n","I'd have thought you, of all people \n","I'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\n","I just never knew you shouldn't\n"," See what I mean?\n"," I've got loads to learn\n"," I bet,\n"," he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, \n","I bet I'm the worst in the class\n","You won't be\n"," There's loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough\n"," While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London\n"," Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep\n"," They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past\n","Anything off the cart, dears?\n"," Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron's ears went pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches\n"," Harry went out into the corridor\n"," He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry but the woman didn't have Mars Bars\n"," What she did have were Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs\n"," Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life\n"," Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts\n"," Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat\n","Hungry, are you?\n","Starving,\n"," Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it\n"," There were four sandwiches inside\n","She always forgets I don't like corned beef\n","Swap you for one of these,\n","Go on \n","You don't want this, it's all dry,\n","She hasn't got much time,\n"," he added quickly, \n","you know, with five of us\n","Go on, have a pasty,\n"," It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten)\n","What are these?\n","They're not really frogs, are they?\n"," He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him\n","No,\n","But see what the card is\n"," I'm missing Agrippa\n","What?\n","Oh, of course, you wouldn't know Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect famous witches and wizards\n"," I've got about five hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy\n"," Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card\n"," It showed a man's face\n"," He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache\n"," Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore\n","So this is Dumbledore!\n","Don't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore!\n","Can I have a frog?\n"," I might get Agrippa thanks \n"," Harry turned over his card and read: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS C onsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel\n"," Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling\n"," Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore's face had disappeared\n","He's gone!\n","Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day,\n","He'll be back\n"," No, I've got Morgana again and I've got about six of her do you want it?\n"," You can start collecting\n"," Ron's eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped\n","Help yourself,\n","But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos\n","Do they?\n"," What, they don't move at all?\n"," Ron sounded amazed\n","Weird!\n"," Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile\n"," Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off them\n"," Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin\n"," He finally tore his eyes away from the Druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans\n","You want to be careful with those,\n"," Ron warned Harry\n","When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe\n"," George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once\n"," Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner\n","Bleaaargh see?\n"," Sprouts\n"," They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans\n"," Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn't touch, which turned out to be pepper\n"," The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder\n"," The neat fields had gone\n"," Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills\n"," There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in\n"," He looked tearful\n","Sorry,\n","but have you seen a toad at all?\n"," When they shook their heads, he wailed, \n","I've lost him! He keeps getting away from me!\n","He'll turn up,\n","Yes,\n","Well, if you see him \n"," He left\n","Don't know why he's so bothered,\n","If I'd brought a toad I'd lose it as quick as I could\n"," Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can't talk\n"," The rat was still snoozing on Ron's lap\n","He might have died and you wouldn't know the difference,\n","I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn't work\n"," I'll show you, look \n"," He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand\n"," It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end\n","Unicorn hair's nearly poking out\n"," Anyway \n"," He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again\n"," The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him\n"," She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes\n","Has anyone seen a toad?\n"," Neville's lost one,\n"," She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth\n","We've already told him we haven't seen it,\n","Oh, are you doing magic?\n"," Let's see it, then\n"," She sat down\n"," Ron looked taken aback\n","Er all right\n"," He cleared his throat\n","Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow\n"," He waved his wand, but nothing happened\n"," Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep\n","Are you sure that's a real spell?\n","Well, it's not very good, is it?\n"," I've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me\n"," Nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, I've heard I've learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough I'm Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?\n"," Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn't learned all the course books by heart either\n","I'm Ron Weasley,\n"," Ron muttered\n","Harry Potter,\n","Are you really?\n","I know all about you, of course I got a few extra books, for background reading, and you're in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century\n","Am I?\n","Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it was me,\n","Do either of you know what house you'll be in?\n"," I've been asking around, and I hope I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn't be too bad\n","Anyway, we'd better go and look for Neville's toad\n"," You two had better change, you know, I expect we'll be there soon\n"," And she left, taking the toadless boy with her\n","Whatever house I'm in, I hope she's not in it,\n"," He threw his wand back into his trunk\n","Stupid spell George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud\n","What house are your brothers in?\n","Gryffindor,\n"," Gloom seemed to be settling on him again\n","Mom and Dad were in it, too\n"," I don't know what they'll say if I'm not\n"," I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin\n","That's the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?\n","Yeah,\n"," He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed\n","You know, I think the ends of Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter,\n","So what do your oldest brothers do now that they've left, anyway?\n"," Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he'd finished school\n","Charlie's in Romania studying dragons, and Bill's in Africa doing something for Gringotts,\n","Did you hear about Gringotts?\n"," It's been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don't suppose you get that with the Muggles someone tried to rob a high security vault\n"," Harry stared\n","Really?\n"," What happened to them?\n","Nothing, that's why it's such big news\n"," They haven't been caught\n"," My dad says it must've been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don't think they took anything, that's what's odd\n"," 'Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who's behind it\n"," Harry turned this news over in his mind\n"," He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned\n"," He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying \n","Voldemort\n"," without worrying\n","What's your Quidditch team?\n","Er I don't know any\n"," Harry confessed\n","What!\n"," Ron looked dumbfounded\n","Oh, you wait, it's the best game in the world \n"," And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the money\n"," He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time\n"," Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin's robe shop\n"," He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he'd shown back in Diagon Alley\n","Is it true?\n","They're saying all down the train that Harry Potter's in this compartment\n"," So it's you, is it?\n","Yes,\n"," He was looking at the other boys\n"," Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean\n"," Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards\n","Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\n","And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy\n"," Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger\n"," Draco Malfoy looked at him\n","Think my name's funny, do you?\n"," No need to ask who you are\n"," My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford\n"," He turned back to Harry\n","You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter\n"," You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort\n"," I can help you there\n"," He held out his hand to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it\n","I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\n"," Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks\n","I'd be careful if I were you, Potter,\n","Unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents\n"," They didn't know what was good for them, either\n"," You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you\n"," Both Harry and Ron stood up\n","Say that again,\n","Oh, you're going to fight us, are you?\n"," Malfoy sneered\n","Unless you get out now,\n","But we don't feet like leaving, do we, boys?\n"," We've eaten all our food and you still seem to have some\n"," Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron Ron leapt forward, but before he'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell\n"," Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle's knuckle Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once\n"," Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they'd heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in\n","What has been going on?\n","I think he's been knocked out,\n"," He looked closer at Scabbers\n","No I don't believe it he's gone back to sleep\n"," And so he had\n","You've met Malfoy before?\n"," Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley\n","I've heard of his family,\n","They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared\n"," Said they'd been bewitched\n"," My dad doesn't believe it\n"," He says Malfoy's father didn't need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side\n"," He turned to Hermione\n","Can we help you with something?\n","You'd better hurry up and put your robes on, I've just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we're nearly there\n"," You haven't been fighting, have you?\n"," You'll be in trouble before we even get there!\n","Scabbers has been fighting, not us,\n","Would you mind leaving while we change?\n","All right I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,\n","And you've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?\n"," Ron glared at her as she left\n"," Harry peered out of the window\n"," It was getting dark\n"," He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky\n"," The train did seem to be slowing down\n"," He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes\n"," Ron's were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them\n"," A voice echoed through the train: \n","We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes' time\n"," Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately\n"," Harry's stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles\n"," They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor\n"," The train slowed right down and finally stopped\n"," People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform\n"," Harry shivered in the cold night air\n"," Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: \n","Firs' years! Firs' years over here! All right there, Harry?\n"," Hagrid's big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads\n","C'mon, follow me any more firs' years?\n"," Mind yer step, now! Firs' years follow me!\n"," Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path\n"," It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there\n"," Nobody spoke much\n"," Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice\n","Yeh'll get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts in a sec,\n"," Hagrid called over his shoulder, \n","jus' round this bend here\n"," There was a loud \n","Oooooh!\n"," The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake\n"," Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers\n","No more'n four to a boat!\n"," Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore\n"," Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione\n","Everyone in?\n"," shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself\n","Right then FORWARD!\n"," And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass\n"," Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead\n"," It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood\n","Heads down!\n"," yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face\n"," They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles\n","Oy, you there! Is this your toad?\n","Trevor!\n"," cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands\n"," Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle\n"," They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door\n","Everyone here?\n"," You there, still got yer toad?\n"," Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door\n"," The door swung open at once\n"," A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there\n"," She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross\n","The firs' years, Professor McGonagall,\n","Thank you, Hagrid\n"," I will take them from here\n"," She pulled the door wide\n"," The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it\n"," The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors\n"," They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor\n"," Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall\n"," They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously\n","Welcome to Hogwarts,\n","The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses\n"," The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts\n"," You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room\n","The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin\n"," Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards\n"," While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points\n"," At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor\n"," I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours\n","The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school\n"," I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting\n"," Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron's smudged nose\n"," Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair\n","I shall return when we are ready for you,\n","Please wait quietly\n"," She left the chamber\n"," Harry swallowed\n","How exactly do they sort us into houses?\n","Some sort of test, I think\n"," Harry's heart gave a horrible jolt\n"," A test?\n"," In front of the whole school?\n"," But he didn't know any magic yet what on earth would he have to do?\n"," He hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived\n"," He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too\n"," No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one she'd need\n"," Harry tried hard not to listen to her\n"," He'd never been more nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue\n"," He kept his eyes fixed on the door\n"," Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom\n"," Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air several people behind him screamed\n","What the ?\n"," He gasped\n"," So did the people around him\n"," About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall\n"," Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years\n"," They seemed to be arguing\n"," What looked like a fat little monk was saying: \n","Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance \n","My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves?\n"," He gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost I say, what are you all doing here?\n"," A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years\n"," Nobody answered\n","New students!\n","About to be Sorted, I suppose?\n"," A few people nodded mutely\n","Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\n","My old house, you know\n","Move along now,\n","The Sorting Ceremony's about to start\n"," Professor McGonagall had returned\n"," One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall\n","Now, form a line,\n"," Professor McGonagall told the first years, \n","and follow me\n"," Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall\n"," Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place\n"," It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting\n"," These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets\n"," At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting\n"," Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them\n"," The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight\n"," Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver\n"," Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars\n"," He heard Hermione whisper, \n","Its bewitched to look like the sky outside\n"," I read about it in Hogwarts, A History\n"," It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens\n"," Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years\n"," On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat\n"," This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty\n"," Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house\n"," Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too\n"," For a few seconds, there was complete silence\n"," Then the hat twitched\n"," A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the hat began to sing: \n","Oh, you may not think I'm pretty, But don't judge on what you see, I'll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me\n"," You can keep your bowlers black, Your top hats sleek and tall, For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all\n"," There's nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can't see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be\n"," You might belong in Gryffindor, Where dwell the brave at heart, Their daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and loyal, Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you've a ready mind, Where those of wit and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You'll make your real friends, Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends\n"," So put me on! Don't be afraid! And don't get in a flap! You're in safe hands (though I have none) For I'm a Thinking Cap!\n"," The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song\n"," It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again\n","So we've just got to try on the hat!\n","I'll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll\n"," Harry\n"," smiled weakly\n"," Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching\n"," The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment\n"," If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him\n"," Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment\n","When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\n","Abbott, Hannah!\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":[" A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down\n"," A moments pause \n","HUFFLEPUFF!\n"," shouted the hat\n"," The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table\n"," Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her\n","Bones, Susan!\n","HUFFLEPUFF!\n"," shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah\n","Boot, Terry!\n","RAVENCLAW!\n"," The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them\n","Brocklehurst, Mandy\n"," went to Ravenclaw too, but \n","Brown, Lavender\n"," became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling\n","Bulstrode, Millicent\n"," then became a Slytherin\n"," Perhaps it was Harry's imagination, after all he'd heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot\n"," He was starting to feel definitely sick now\n"," He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school\n"," He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him\n","Finch-Fletchley, Justin!\n","HUFFLEPUFF!\n"," Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide\n","Finnigan, Seamus,\n"," the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor\n","Granger, Hermione!\n"," Her mione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head\n","GRYFFINDOR!\n"," shouted the hat\n"," Ron groaned\n"," A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous\n"," The hat took a long time to decide with Neville\n"," When it finally shouted, \n","GRYFFINDOR,\n"," Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to \n","MacDougal, Morag\n"," Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, \n","SLYTHERIN!\n"," Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself\n"," There weren't many people left now\n","Moon\n"," , \n","Nott\n"," , \n","Parkinson\n"," , then a pair of twin girls, \n","Patil\n"," and \n","Patil\n"," , then \n","Perks, Sally-Anne\n"," , and then, at last \n","Potter, Harry!\n"," As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall\n","Potter, did she say?\n","The Harry Potter?\n"," The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him\n"," Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat\n"," He waited\n","Hmm,\n","Difficult\n"," Very difficult\n"," Plenty of courage, I see\n"," Not a bad mind either\n"," There's talent, A my goodness, yes and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting \n","So where shall I put you?\n"," Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin\n","Not Slytherin, eh?\n","Are you sure?\n"," You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that no?\n"," Well, if you're sure better be GRYFFINDOR!\n"," Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall\n"," He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table\n"," He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet\n"," Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, \n","We got Potter! We got Potter!\n"," Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier\n"," The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water\n"," He could see the High Table properly now\n"," At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up\n"," Harry grinned back\n"," And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore\n"," Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train\n"," Dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts\n"," Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron\n"," He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban\n"," And now there were only three people left to be sorted\n","Thomas, Dean,\n"," a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table\n","Turpin, Lisa,\n"," became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron's turn\n"," He was pale green by now\n"," Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, \n","GRYFFINDOR!\n"," Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him\n","Well done, Ron, excellent,\n","Zabini, Blaise,\n"," was made a Slytherin\n"," Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away\n"," Harry looked down at his empty gold plate\n"," He had only just realized how hungry he was\n"," The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago\n"," Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet\n"," He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there\n","Welcome,\n","Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts!

Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes\n"," Potatoes, Harry?\n"," Harry's mouth fell open\n"," The dishes in front of him were now piled with food\n"," He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs\n"," The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked\n"," Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick\n"," Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat\n"," It was all delicious\n","That does look good,\n","Can't you ?\n","I haven't eaten for nearly five hundred years,\n","I don't need to, of course, but one does miss it\n"," I don't think I've introduced myself?\n"," Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service\n"," Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower\n","I know who you are!\n","My brothers told me about you you're Nearly Headless Nick!\n","I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy \n"," the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted\n","Nearly Headless?\n"," How can you be nearly headless?\n"," Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wanted\n","Like this,\n"," He seized his left ear and pulled\n"," His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge\n"," Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly\n","So new Gryffindors!

The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable he's the Slytherin ghost\n"," Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood\n"," He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements\n","How did he get covered in blood?\n"," When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before\n"," A moment later the desserts appeared\n"," Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families\n","I'm half-and-half,\n","Me dad's a Muggle\n"," Mom didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married\n"," Bit of a nasty shock for him\n"," The others laughed\n","What about you, Neville?\n","Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch,\n","but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages\n"," My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned but nothing happened until I was eight\n"," Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go\n"," But I bounced all the way down the garden and into the road\n"," They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy\n"," And you should have seen their faces when I got in here they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see\n"," Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad\n"," On Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (\n","I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult \n","; \n","You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing \n",")\n"," Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again\n"," Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet\n"," Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore\n"," Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin\n"," It happened very suddenly\n"," The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into Harry's eyes and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry's forehead\n","Ouch!\n"," Harry clapped a hand to his head\n","What is it?\n","N-nothing\n"," The pain had gone as quickly as it had come\n"," Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look a feeling that he didn't like Harry at all\n","Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\n","Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you?\n"," No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's Professor Snape\n"," He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want to everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job\n"," Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape\n"," Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again\n"," At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again\n"," The hall fell silent\n","Ahem just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered\n"," I have a few start-of-term notices to give you\n","First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils\n"," And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well\n"," Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins\n","Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term\n"," Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch\n","And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death\n"," Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did\n","He's not serious?\n"," he muttered to Percy\n","Must be,\n","It's odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere the forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that\n"," I do think he might have told us prefects, at least\n","And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\n"," cried Dumbledore\n"," Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed\n"," Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words\n","Everyone pick their favorite tune,\n","and off we go!\n"," And the school bellowed: \n","Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach us something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, Our heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now they're bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, So teach us things worth knowing, Bring back what we've forgot, just do your best, we'll do the rest, And learn until our brains all rot\n"," Everybody finished the song at different times\n"," At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march\n"," Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest\n","Ah, music,\n","A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime\n"," Off you trot!\n"," The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase\n"," Harry's legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food\n"," They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt\n"," A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him\n","Peeves,\n","A poltergeist\n"," He raised his voice, \n","Peeves show yourself\n"," A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered\n","Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\n"," There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks\n","Oooooooh!\n","Ickle Firsties! What fun!\n"," He swooped suddenly at them\n"," They all ducked\n","Go away, Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!\n"," barked Percy\n"," Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville's head\n"," They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed\n","You want to watch out for Peeves,\n","The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even listen to us prefects\n"," Here we are\n"," At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress\n","Password?\n","Caput Draconis,\n"," They all scrambled through it Neville needed a leg up and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs\n"," Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another\n"," At the top of a spiral staircase they were obviously in one of the towers they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains\n"," Their trunks had already been brought up\n"," Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed\n","Great food, isn't it?\n"," Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings\n","Get off, Scabbers! He's chewing my sheets\n"," Harry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once\n"," Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream\n"," He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny\n"," Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it then Malfoy turned into the hooknosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking\n"," He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn't remember the dream at all\n"," There, look\n","Where?\n","Next to the tall kid with the red hair\n","Wearing the glasses?\n","Did you see his face?\n","Did you see his scar?\n"," Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day\n"," People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring\n"," Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes\n"," There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump\n"," It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot\n"," The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk\n"," The ghosts didn't help, either\n"," It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open\n"," Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class\n"," He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, \n","GOT YOUR CONK!\n"," Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch\n"," Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning\n"," Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor\n"," He wouldn't believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing\n"," Filch owned a cat called Mrs Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch's\n"," She patrolled the corridors alone\n"," Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she'd whisk off for Filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds later\n"," Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts\n"," The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs Norris a good kick\n"," And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves\n"," There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words\n"," They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets\n"," Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for\n"," Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost\n"," Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him\n"," Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up\n"," Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk\n"," At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight\n"," Professor McGonagall was again different\n"," Harry had been quite right to think she wasn't a teacher to cross\n"," Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class\n","Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,\n","Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back\n"," You have been warned\n"," Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again\n"," They were all very impressed and couldn't wait to get started, but soon realized they weren't going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time\n"," After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle\n"," By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile\n"," The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke\n"," His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story\n"," Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else\n"," Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards\n"," There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn't have much of a head start\n"," Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron\n"," They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once\n","What have we got today?\n","Double Potions with the Slytherins,\n","Snape's Head of Slytherin House\n"," They say he always favors them we'll be able to see if it's true\n","Wish McGonagall favored us,\n"," Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before\n"," Just then, the mail arrived\n"," Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps\n"," Hedwig hadn't brought Harry anything so far\n"," She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls\n"," This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry's plate\n"," Harry tore it open at once\n"," Send us an answer back with Hedwig\n"," Hagrid Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again\n"," It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far\n"," At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him\n"," By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong\n"," Snape didn't dislike Harry he hated him\n"," Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons\n"," It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls\n"," Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry's name\n","Ah, Yes,\n","Harry Potter\n"," Our new celebrity\n"," Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands\n"," Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class\n"," His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none of Hagrid's warmth\n"," They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels\n","You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,\n"," he began\n"," He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort\n","As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic\n"," I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses\n"," I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach\n"," More silence followed this little speech\n"," Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows\n"," Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn't a dunderhead\n","Potter!\n","What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\n"," Powdered root of what to an infusion of what?\n"," Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione's hand had shot into the air\n","I don't know, sir,\n"," Snape's lips curled into a sneer\n","Tut, tut fame clearly isn't everything\n"," He ignored Hermione's hand\n","Let's try again\n"," Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?\n"," Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have the faintest idea what a bezoar was\n"," He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter\n","I don't know, sir\n","Thought you wouldn't open a book before coming, eh, Potter?\n"," Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes\n"," He had looked through his books at the Dursleys', but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?\n"," Snape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand\n","What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?\n"," At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling\n","I don't know,\n","I think Hermione does, though, why don't you try her?\n"," A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked\n"," Snape, however, was not pleased\n","Sit down,\n"," he snapped at Hermione\n","For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death\n"," A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons\n"," As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite\n"," Well?\n"," Why aren't you all copying that down?\n"," There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment\n","And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter\n"," Things didn't improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued\n"," Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils\n"," He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like\n"," He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon\n"," Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus's cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people's shoes\n"," Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs\n","Idiot boy!\n"," snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand\n","I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?\n"," Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose\n","Take him up to the hospital wing,\n"," Snape spat at Seamus\n"," Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville\n","You Potter why didn't you tell him not to add the quills?\n"," Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you?\n"," That's another point you've lost for Gryffindor\n"," This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron\n","Don't push it,\n"," he muttered, \n","I've heard Snape can turn very nasty\n"," As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry's mind was racing and his spirits were low\n"," He'd lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week why did Snape hate him so much?\n","Cheer up,\n","Snape's always taking points off Fred and George\n"," Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?\n"," At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds\n"," Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest\n"," A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door\n"," When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks\n"," Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, \n","Back, Fang back\n"," Hagrid's big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open\n","Hang on,\n","Back, Fang\n"," He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound\n"," There was only one room inside\n"," Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it\n","Make yerselves at home,\n"," Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked\n","This is Ron,\n"," Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate\n","Another Weasley, eh?\n"," I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away from the forest\n"," The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons\n"," Fang rested his head on Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes\n"," Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch \n","that old git\n","An' as fer that cat, Mrs Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime\n"," D'yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere?\n"," Can't get rid of her Filch puts her up to it\n"," Harry told Hagrid about Snape's lesson\n"," Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students\n","But he seemed to really hate me\n","Rubbish!\n","Why should he?\n","How's yer brother Charlie?\n","I liked him a lot great with animals\n"," Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose\n"," While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy\n"," It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet: GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown\n"," Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken\n"," The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day\n","But we're not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what's good for you,\n"," Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned the date\n","Hagrid!\n","that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might've been happening while we were there!\n"," There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes this time\n"," He grunted and offered him another rock cake\n"," Harry read the story again\n"," The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day\n"," Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package\n"," Had that been what the thieves were looking for?\n"," As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they'd been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he'd had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid\n"," Had Hagrid collected that package just in time?\n"," Where was it now?\n"," And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn't want to tell Harry?\n"," Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy\n"," Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn't have to put up with Malfoy much\n"," Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan\n"," Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together\n","Typical,\n","Just what I always wanted\n"," To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy\n"," He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else\n","You don't know that you'll make a fool of yourself,\n","Anyway, I know Malfoy's always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that's all talk\n"," Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot\n"," He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters\n"," He wasn't the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick\n"," Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom\n"," Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly\n"," Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer\n"," Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly\n"," Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move\n"," Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one\n"," Privately, Harry felt she'd had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground\n"," Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was\n"," This was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book not that she hadn't tried\n"," At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she'd gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages\n"," Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione's lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail\n"," Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course\n"," Malfoy's eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table\n"," A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother\n"," He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke\n","It's a Remembrall!\n"," he explained\n","Gran knows I forget things this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do\n"," Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red oh \n"," His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, \n"," you've forgotten something \n"," Neville was trying to remember what he'd forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand\n"," Harry and Ron jumped to their feet\n"," They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash\n","What's going on?\n","Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor\n"," Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table\n","Just looking,\n"," At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson\n"," It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance\n"," The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground\n"," Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left\n"," Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived\n"," She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk\n","Well, what are you all waiting for?\n"," she barked\n","Everyone stand by a broomstick\n"," Come on, hurry up\n"," Harry glanced down at his broom\n"," It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles\n","Stick out your right hand over your broom,\n"," called Madam Hooch at the front, \n","and say Up!'\n","UP\n"," everyone shouted\n"," Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did\n"," Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all\n"," Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips\n"," Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years\n","Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\n","Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly\n"," On my whistle three two \n"," But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's lips\n","Come back, boy!\n"," she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle twelve feet twenty feet\n"," Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and WHAM a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap\n"," His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight\n"," Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his\n","Broken wrist,\n"," Harry heard her mutter\n","Come on, boy it's all right, up you get\n"," She turned to the rest of the class\n","None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say Quidditch\n","' Come on, dear\n"," Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him\n"," No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter\n","Did you see his face, the great lump?\n"," The other Slytherins joined in\n","Shut up, Malfoy,\n"," snapped Parvati Patil\n","Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?\n","Never thought you'd like fat little crybabies, Parvati\n","Look!\n","It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him\n"," The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up\n","Give that here, Malfoy,\n"," Everyone stopped talking to watch\n"," Malfoy smiled nastily\n","I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find how about up a tree?\n","Give it here!\n"," Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off\n"," He hadn't been lying, he could fly well\n"," Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, \n","Come and get it, Potter!\n"," Harry grabbed his broom\n","No!\n"," shouted Hermione Granger\n","Madam Hooch told us not to move you'll get us all into trouble\n"," Harry ignored her\n"," Blood was pounding in his ears\n"," He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being taught this was easy, this was wonderful\n"," He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron\n"," He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair\n"," Malfoy looked stunned\n","Give it here,\n"," Harry called, \n","or I'll knock you off that broom!\n","Oh, yeah?\n"," Harry knew, somehow, what to do\n"," He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin\n"," Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady\n"," A few people below were clapping\n","No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\n"," Harry called\n"," The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy\n","Catch it if you can, then!\n"," he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground\n"," Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall\n"," He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching he stretched out his hand a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist\n","HARRY POTTER!\n"," His heart sank faster than he'd just dived\n"," Professor McGonagall was running toward them\n"," He got to his feet, trembling\n","Never in all my time at Hogwarts \n"," Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, \n"," how dare you might have broken your neck \n","It wasn't his fault, Professor \n","Be quiet, Miss Patil \n","But Malfoy \n","That's enough, Mr Weasley\n"," Potter, follow me, now\n"," Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward the castle\n"," He was going to be expelled, he just knew it\n"," He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice\n"," Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up\n"," Now he'd done it\n"," He hadn't even lasted two weeks\n"," He'd be packing his bags in ten minutes\n"," What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?\n"," Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn't say a word to him\n"," She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her\n"," Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore\n"," He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper\n"," Perhaps he could be Hagrid's assistant\n"," His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid's bag\n"," Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom\n"," She opened the door and poked her head inside\n","Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?\n"," Wood?\n"," thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him?\n"," But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick's class looking confused\n","Follow me, you two,\n","In here\n"," Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard\n","Out, Peeves!\n"," she barked\n"," Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing\n"," Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys\n","Potter, this is Oliver Wood\n"," Wood I've found you a Seeker\n"," Wood's expression changed from puzzlement to delight\n","Are you serious, Professor?\n","Absolutely,\n","The boy's a natural\n"," I've never seen anything like it\n"," Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?\n"," Harry nodded silently\n"," He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs\n","He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,\n"," Professor McGonagall told Wood\n","Didn't even scratch himself\n"," Charlie Weasley couldn't have done it\n"," Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once\n","Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\n","Wood's captain of the Gryffindor team,\n"," Professor McGonagall explained\n","He's just the build for a Seeker, too,\n","Light speedy we'll have to get him a decent broom, Professor a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I'd say\n","I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend the firstyear rule\n"," Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year\n"," Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape in the face for weeks\n"," Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry\n","I want to hear you're training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you\n"," Then she suddenly smiled\n","Your father would have been proud,\n","He was an excellent Quidditch player himself\n","You're joking\n"," It was dinnertime\n"," Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he'd left the grounds with Professor McGonagall\n"," Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he'd forgotten all about it\n","Seeker?\n","But first years never you must be the youngest house player in about \n"," a century,\n"," He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon\n","Wood told me\n"," Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry\n","I start training next week,\n","Only don't tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret\n"," Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over\n","Well done,\n","Wood told us\n"," We're on the team too Beaters\n","I tell you, we're going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,\n","We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is going to be brilliant\n"," You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us\n","Anyway, we've got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he's found a new secret passageway out of the school\n","Bet it's that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week\n"," See you\n"," Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle\n","Having a last meal, Potter?\n"," When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?\n","You're a lot braver now that you're back on the ground and you've got your little friends with you,\n"," There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl\n","I'd take you on anytime on my own,\n","Tonight, if you want\n"," Wizard's duel\n"," Wands only no contact\n"," What's the matter?\n"," Never heard of a wizard's duel before, I suppose?\n","Of course he has,\n","I'm his second, who's yours?\n"," Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up\n","Crabbe,\n","Midnight all right?\n"," We'll meet you in the trophy room; that's always unlocked\n"," When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other\n","What is a wizard's duel?\n","And what do you mean, you're my second?\n","Well, a second's there to take over if you die,\n"," Catching the look on Harry's face, he added quickly, \n","But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards\n"," The most you and Malfoy'll be able to do is send sparks at each other\n"," Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage\n"," I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway\n","And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?\n","Throw it away and punch him on the nose,\n"," Ron suggested\n","Excuse me\n"," They both looked up\n"," It was Hermione Granger\n","Can't a person eat in peace in this place?\n"," Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry\n","I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying \n","Bet you could,\n"," Ron muttered\n"," and you mustn't go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you'll lose Gryffindor if you're caught, and you're bound to be\n"," It's really very selfish of you\n","And it's really none of your business,\n","Good-bye,\n"," All the same, it wasn't what you'd call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn't back from the hospital wing)\n"," Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as \n","If he tries to curse you, you'd better dodge it, because I can't remember how to block them\n"," There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today\n"," On the other hand, Malfoy's sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face\n"," He couldn't miss it\n","Half-past eleven,\n"," Ron muttered at last, \n","we'd better go\n"," They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room\n"," A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows\n"," They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, \n","I can't believe you're going to do this, Harry\n"," A lamp flickered on\n"," It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown\n","You!\n","Go back to bed!\n","I almost told your brother,\n"," Hermione snapped, \n","Percy he's a prefect, he'd put a stop to this\n"," Harry couldn't believe anyone could be so interfering\n","Come on,\n"," He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole\n"," Hermione wasn't going to give up that easily\n"," She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose\n","Don't you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don't want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you'll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells\n","Go away\n"," But what they were, they didn't find out\n"," Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting\n"," The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower\n","Now what am I going to do?\n","That's your problem,\n","We've got to go, we're going to be late\n"," They hadn't even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them\n","I'm coming with you,\n","You are not\n","D'you think I'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me?\n"," If he finds all three of us I'll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up\n","You've got some nerve \n","Shut up, both of you!\n"," I heard something\n"," It was a sort of snuffling\n","Mrs Norris?\n"," breathed Ron, squinting through the dark\n"," It wasn't Mrs Norris\n"," It was Neville\n"," He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer\n","Thank goodness you found me! I've been out here for hours, I couldn't remember the new password to get in to bed\n","Keep your voice down, Neville\n"," The password's Pig snout' but it won't help you now, the Fat Lady's gone off somewhere\n","How's your arm?\n","Fine,\n","Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute\n","Good well, look, Neville, we've got to be somewhere, we'll see you later \n","Don't leave me!\n","I don't want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron's been past twice already\n"," Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville\n","If either of you get us caught, I'll never rest until I've learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you\n"," Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward\n"," They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows\n"," At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs Norris, but they were lucky\n"," They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room\n"," Malfoy and Crabbe weren't there yet\n"," The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them\n"," Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness\n"," They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room\n"," Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once\n"," The minutes crept by\n","He's late, maybe he's chickened out,\n"," Then a noise in the next room made them jump\n"," Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasn't Malfoy\n","Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner\n"," It was Filch speaking to Mrs Norris\n"," Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch's voice\n"," Neville's robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room\n","They're in here somewhere,\n"," they heard him mutter, \n","probably hiding\n","This way!\n"," Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor\n"," They could hear Filch getting nearer\n"," Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor\n"," The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle\n","RUN!\n"," Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room\n","I think we've lost him,\n"," Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead\n"," Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering\n"," I told you,\n"," Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, \n","I told you\n","We've got to get back to Gryffindor tower,\n","quickly as possible\n","Malfoy tricked you,\n","You realize that, don't you?\n"," He was never going to meet you Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off\n"," Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going to tell her that\n","Let's go\n"," It wasn't going to be that simple\n"," They hadn't gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them\n"," It was Peeves\n"," He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight\n","Shut up, Peeves please you'll get us thrown out\n"," Peeves cackled\n","Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties?\n"," Tut, tut, tut\n"," Naughty, naughty, you'll get caughty\n","Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, please\n","Should tell Filch, I should,\n","It's for your own good, you know\n","Get out of the way,\n"," snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake\n","STUDENTS OUT OF BED!\n"," Peeves bellowed, \n","STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!\n"," Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door and it was locked\n","This is it!\n"," Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, \n","We're done for! This is the end!\n"," They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves's shouts\n","Oh, move over,\n"," Hermione snarled\n","Alohomora!\n"," The lock clicked and the door swung open they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening\n","Which way did they go, Peeves?\n"," Filch was saying\n","Quick, tell me\n","Say please\n","'\n","Don't mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?\n","Shan't say nothing if you don't say please,\n","All right please\n","NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\n"," And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage\n","He thinks this door is locked,\n","I think we'll be okay get off, Neville!\n"," For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry's bathrobe for the last minute\n","What?\n"," Harry turned around and saw, quite clearly, what\n"," For a moment, he was sure he'd walked into a nightmare this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far\n"," They weren't in a room, as he had supposed\n"," They were in a corridor\n"," The forbidden corridor on the third floor\n"," And now they knew why it was forbidden\n"," They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor\n"," It had three heads\n"," Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs\n"," It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant\n"," Harry groped for the doorknob between Filch and death, he'd take Filch\n"," They fell backward Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor\n"," Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster\n"," They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor\n","Where on earth have you all been?\n","Never mind that pig snout, pig snout,\n"," panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward\n"," They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs\n"," Neville, indeed, looked as if he'd never speak again\n","What do they think they're doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?\n","If any dog needs exercise, that one does\n"," Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again\n","You don't use your eyes, any of you, do you?\n"," she snapped\n","Didn't you see what it was standing on\n","The floor?\n"," Harry suggested\n","I wasn't looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads\n","No, not the floor\n"," It was standing on a trapdoor\n"," It's obviously guarding something\n"," She stood up, glaring at them\n","I hope you're pleased with yourselves\n"," We could all have been killed or worse, expelled\n"," Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to bed\n"," Ron stared after her, his mouth open\n","No, we don't mind,\n","You'd think we dragged her along, wouldn't you\n"," But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed\n"," It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was\n"," Malfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful\n"," Indeed, by the next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one\n"," In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection\n","It's either really valuable or really dangerous,\n","Or both,\n"," But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long, they didn't have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues\n"," Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor\n"," All Neville cared about was never going near the dog again\n"," Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus\n"," All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later\n"," As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls\n"," Harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor\n"," They had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel\n"," It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody knowing you've got a broomstick or they'll all want one\n"," Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the Quidditch field at seven o'clock for your first training session\n"," Professor McGonagall Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron to read\n","A Nimbus Two Thousand!\n"," Ron moaned enviously\n","I've never even touched one\n"," They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle\n"," Malfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it\n","That's a broomstick,\n","You'll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren't allowed them\n"," Ron couldn't resist it\n","It's not any old broomstick,\n","it's a Nimbus Two Thousand\n"," What did you say you've got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?\n"," Ron grinned at Harry\n","Comets look flashy, but they're not in the same league as the Nimbus\n","What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn't afford half the handle,\n"," Malfoy snapped back\n","I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig\n"," Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's elbow\n","Not arguing, I hope, boys?\n"," he squeaked\n","Potter's been sent a broomstick, Professor,\n","Yes, yes, that's right,\n","Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter\n"," And what model is it?\n","A Nimbus Two Thousand, it is,\n","And it's really thanks to Malfoy here that I've got it,\n"," he added\n"," Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at Malfoy's obvious rage and confusion\n","Well, it's true,\n"," Harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase, \n","If he hadn't stolen Neville's Remembrall I wouldn't be on the team\n","So I suppose you think that's a reward for breaking rules?\n"," came an angry voice from just behind them\n"," Hermione was stomping up the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry's hand\n","I thought you weren't speaking to us?\n","Yes, don't stop now,\n","it's doing us so much good\n"," Hermione marched away with her nose in the air\n"," Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day\n"," It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch field where he'd be learning to play that night\n"," He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at last\n","Wow,\n"," Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread\n"," Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful\n"," Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top\n"," As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field\n"," Held never been inside the stadium before\n"," Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on\n"," At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end\n"," They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high\n"," Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground\n"," What a feeling he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field\n"," The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch\n","Hey, Potter, come down!\n"," Oliver Wood had arrived\n"," He was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm\n"," Harry landed next to him\n","Very nice,\n","I see what McGonagall meant you really are a natural\n"," I'm just going to teach you the rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times a week\n"," He opened the crate\n"," Inside were four different-sized balls\n","Right,\n","Now, Quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it's not too easy to play\n"," There are seven players on each side\n"," Three of them are called Chasers\n","Three Chasers,\n"," Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball\n","This ball's called the Quaffle,\n","The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal\n"," Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops\n"," Follow me?\n","The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\n"," Harry recited\n","So that's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops, isn't it?\n","What's basketball?\n","Never mind,\n","Now, there's another player on each side who's called the Keeper I'm Keeper for Gryffindor\n"," I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring\n","Three Chasers, one Keeper,\n","And they play with the Quaffle\n"," Okay, got that\n"," So what are they for?\n"," He pointed at the three balls left inside the box\n","I'll show you now,\n","Take this\n"," He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat\n","I'm going to show you what the Bludgers do,\n","These two are the Bludgers\n"," He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red Quaffle\n"," Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box\n","Stand back,\n"," Wood warned Harry\n"," He bent down and freed one of the Bludgers\n"," At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at Harry's face\n"," Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground\n","See?\n"," Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely\n","The Bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms\n"," That's why you have two Beaters on each team the Weasley twins are ours it's their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team\n"," So think you've got all that?\n","Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\n"," Harry reeled off\n","Very good,\n","Er have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\n","Never at Hogwarts\n"," We've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that\n"," Now, the last member of the team is the Seeker\n"," That's you\n"," And you don't have to worry about the Quaffle or the Bludgers \n"," unless they crack my head open\n","Don't worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers I mean, they're like a pair of human Bludgers themselves\n"," Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball\n"," Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut\n"," It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings\n","This,\n","is the Golden Snitch, and it's the most important ball of the lot\n"," It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see\n"," It's the Seeker's job to catch it\n"," You've got to weave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it before the other team's Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win\n"," That's why Seekers get fouled so much\n"," A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages I think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep\n","Well, that's it any questions?\n"," Harry shook his head\n"," He understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem\n","We won't practice with the Snitch yet,\n","it's too dark, we might lose it\n"," Let's try you out with a few of these\n"," He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch\n"," Harry didn't miss a single one, and Wood was delighted\n"," After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on\n","That Quidditch Cup'll have our name on it this year,\n","I wouldn't be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played for England if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons\n"," Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he'd already been at Hogwarts two months\n"," The castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had\n"," His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics\n"," On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors\n"," Even better, Professor Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try since they'd seen him make Neville's toad zoom around the classroom\n"," Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice\n"," Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville had been trying to catch his eye)\n"," Ron, however, was to be working with Hermione Granger\n"," It was hard to tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier about this\n"," She hadn't spoken to either of them since the day Harry's broomstick had arrived\n","Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!\n"," squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of books as usual\n","Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick\n"," It was very difficult\n"," Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop\n"," Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it Harry had to put it out with his hat\n"," Ron, at the next table, wasn't having much more luck\n","Wingardium Leviosa!\n"," he shouted, waving his long arms like a windmill\n","You're saying it wrong,\n"," Harry heard Hermione snap\n","It's Wing-gardium Levi-o-sa, make the gar' nice and long\n","You do it, then, if you're so clever,\n"," Ron snarled\n","Wingardium Leviosa!\n"," Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads\n","Oh, well done!\n"," cried Professor Flitwick, clapping\n","Everyone see here, Miss Granger's done it!\n"," Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class\n","It's no wonder no one can stand her,\n","she's a nightmare, honestly\n"," Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him\n"," It was Hermione\n"," Harry caught a glimpse of her face and was startled to see that she was in tears\n","I think she heard you\n","So?\n","She must've noticed she's got no friends\n"," Hermione didn't turn up for the next class and wasn't seen all afternoon\n"," On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' bathroom and wanted to be left alone\n"," Ron looked still more awkward at this, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Halloween decorations put Hermione out of their minds\n"," A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, making the candles in the pumpkins stutter\n"," The feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet\n"," Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror on his face\n"," Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, \n","Troll in the dungeons thought you ought to know\n"," He then sank to the floor in a dead faint\n"," There was an uproar\n"," It took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of Professor Dumbledore's wand to bring silence\n","Prefects,\n"," he rumbled, \n","lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately!\n"," Percy was in his element\n","Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now\n"," Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I'm a prefect!\n","How could a troll get in?\n","Don't ask me, they're supposed to be really stupid,\n","Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke\n"," They passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions\n"," As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm\n","I've just thought Hermione\n","What about her?\n","She doesn't know about the troll\n"," Ron bit his lip\n","Oh, all right,\n"," he snapped\n","But Percy'd better not see us\n"," Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the girls' bathroom\n"," They had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them\n","Percy!\n"," hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin\n"," Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape\n"," He crossed the corridor and disappeared from view\n","What's he doing?\n","Why isn't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers?\n","Search me\n"," Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after Snape's fading footsteps\n","He's heading for the third floor,\n","Can you smell something?\n"," Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean\n"," And then they heard it a low grunting, and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet\n"," Ron pointed at the end of a passage to the left, something huge was moving toward them\n"," They shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight\n"," It was a horrible sight\n"," Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut\n"," It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet\n"," The smell coming from it was incredible\n"," It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long\n"," The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside\n"," It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room\n","The keys in the lock,\n"," Harry muttered\n","We could lock it in\n","Good idea,\n"," They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll wasn't about to come out of it\n"," With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it\n","Yes!\n"," Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop a high, petrified scream and it was coming from the chamber they'd just chained up\n","Oh, no,\n","It's the girls' bathroom!\n"," Harry gasped\n","Hermione!\n"," It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they have?\n"," Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned the key, fumbling in their panic\n"," Harry pulled the door open and they ran inside\n"," Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, looking as if she was about to faint\n"," The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went\n","Confuse it!\n"," The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione\n"," It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise\n"," Its mean little eyes saw Harry\n"," It hesitated, then made for him instead, lifting its club as it went\n","Oy, pea-brain!\n"," yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it\n"," The troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to run around it\n","Come on, run, run!\n"," Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull her toward the door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against the wall, her mouth open with terror\n"," The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk\n"," It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape\n"," Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll's neck from behind\n"," The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been in his hand when he'd jumped \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils\n"," Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club\n"," Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head: \n","Wingardium Leviosa!\n"," The club flew suddenly out of the troll's hand, rose high, high up into the air, turned slowly over and dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head\n"," The troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room tremble\n"," Harry got to his feet\n"," He was shaking and out of breath\n"," Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done\n"," It was Hermione who spoke first\n","Is it dead?\n","I don't think so,\n"," He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll's nose\n"," It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue\n","Urgh troll boogers\n"," He wiped it on the troll's trousers\n"," A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up\n"," They hadn't realized what a racket they had been making, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll's roars\n"," A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear\n"," Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his heart\n"," Snape bent over the troll\n"," Professor McGonagall was looking at Ron and Harry\n"," Harry had never seen her look so angry\n"," Her lips were white\n"," Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded quickly from Harry's mind\n","What on earth were you thinking of?\n"," Harry looked at Ron, who was still standing with his wand in the air\n","You're lucky you weren't killed\n"," Why aren't you in your dormitory?\n"," Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look\n"," Harry looked at the floor\n"," He wished Ron would put his wand down\n"," Then a small voice came out of the shadows\n","Please, Professor McGonagall they were looking for me\n","Miss Granger!\n"," Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last\n","I went looking for the troll because I I thought I could deal with it on my own you know, because I've read all about them\n"," Ron dropped his wand\n"," Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher?\n","If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now\n"," Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club\n"," They didn't have time to come and fetch anyone\n"," It was about to finish me off when they arrived\n"," Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn't new to them\n","Well in that case \n","Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?\n"," Hermione hung her head\n"," Harry was speechless\n"," Hermione was the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, pretending she had, to get them out of trouble\n"," It was as if Snape had started handing out sweets\n","Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this,\n","I'm very disappointed in you\n"," If you're not hurt at all, you'd better get off to Gryffindor tower\n"," Students are finishing the feast in their houses\n"," Hermione left\n"," Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron\n","Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll\n"," You each win Gryffindor five points\n"," Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this\n"," You may go\n"," They hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they had climbed two floors up\n"," It was a relief to be away from the smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else\n","We should have gotten more than ten points,\n"," Ron grumbled\n","Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's\n","Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,\n"," Ron admitted\n","Mind you, we did save her\n","She might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in with her,\n"," Harry reminded him\n"," They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady\n","Pig snout,\n"," The common room was packed and noisy\n"," Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up\n"," Hermione, however, stood alone by the door, waiting for them\n"," There was a very embarrassed pause\n","Thanks,\n"," and hurried off to get plates\n"," But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend\n"," There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them\n"," A s they entered November, the weather turned very cold\n"," The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel\n"," Every morning the ground was covered in frost\n"," Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots\n"," The Quidditch season had begun\n"," On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin\n"," If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship\n"," Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret\n"," But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know which was worse people telling him he'd be brilliant or people telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding a mattress\n"," It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend\n"," He didn't know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do\n"," She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read\n"," Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert\n"," Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it\n"," The day before Harry's first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar\n"," They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard\n"," Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping\n"," Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn't be allowed\n"," Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape's eye\n"," He limped over\n"," He hadn't seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway\n","What's that you've got there, Potter?\n"," It was Quidditch Through the Ages\n"," Harry showed him\n","Library books are not to be taken outside the school,\n","Give it to me\n"," Five points from Gryffindor\n","He's just made that rule up,\n"," Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away\n","Wonder what's wrong with his leg?\n","Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him,\n"," The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening\n"," Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window\n"," Hermione was checking Harry and Ron's Charms homework for them\n"," She would never let them copy (\n","How will you learn?\n","), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway\n"," Harry felt restless\n"," He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow\n"," Why should he be afraid of Snape?\n"," Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it\n","Better you than me,\n"," He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked\n"," There was no answer\n"," He knocked again\n"," Nothing\n"," Perhaps Snape had left the book in there?\n"," It was worth a try\n"," He pushed the door ajar and peered inside \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and a horrible scene met his eyes\n"," Snape and Filch were inside, alone\n"," Snape was holding his robes above his knees\n"," One of his legs was bloody and mangled\n"," Filch was handing Snape bandages\n","Blasted thing,\n"," Snape was saying\n","How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?\n"," Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but \n","POTTER!\n"," Snape's face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg\n"," Harry gulped\n","I just wondered if I could have my book back\n","GET OUT! OUT!\n"," Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor\n"," He sprinted back upstairs\n","Did you get it?\n","What's the matter?\n"," In a low whisper, Harry told them what he'd seen\n","You know what this means?\n"," he finished breathlessly\n","He tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That's where he was going when we saw him he's after whatever it's guarding! And I'd bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!\n"," Hermione's eyes were wide\n","I know he's not very nice, but he wouldn't try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe\n","Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,\n"," snapped Ron\n","I'm with Harry\n"," I wouldn't put anything past Snape\n"," But what's he after?\n"," What's that dog guarding?\n"," Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question\n"," Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn't sleep\n"," He tried to empty his mind he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but the expression on Snape's face when Harry had seen his leg wasn't easy to forget\n"," The next morning dawned very bright and cold\n"," The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match\n","You've got to eat some breakfast\n","I don't want anything\n","Just a bit of toast,\n"," wheedled Hermione\n","I'm not hungry\n"," Harry felt terrible\n"," In an hour's time he'd be walking onto the field\n","Harry, you need your strength,\n","Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team\n","Thanks, Seamus,\n"," By eleven o'clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch\n"," Many students had binoculars\n"," The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes\n"," Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row\n"," As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined\n"," Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors\n"," Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green)\n"," Wood cleared his throat for silence\n","Okay, men,\n","And women,\n","And women,\n"," Wood agreed\n","This is it\n","The big one,\n","The one we've all been waiting for,\n","We know Oliver's speech by heart,\n"," Fred told Harry, \n","we were on the team last year\n","Shut up, you two,\n","This is the best team Gryffindor's had in years\n"," We're going to win\n"," I know it\n"," He glared at them all as if to say, \n","Or else\n","Right\n"," It's time\n"," Good luck, all of you\n"," Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren't going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers\n"," Madam Hooch was refereeing\n"," She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand\n","Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,\n"," Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year\n"," Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him\n"," Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd\n"," His heart skipped\n"," He felt braver\n","Mount your brooms, please\n"," Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand\n"," Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle\n"," Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air\n"," They were off\n","And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too \n","JORDAN!\n","Sorry, Professor\n"," The Weasley twins' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall\n","And she's really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood's, last year only a reserve back to Johnson and no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes Flint flying like an eagle up there he's going to sc no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle that's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and OUCH that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger Quaffle taken by the Slytherins that's Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he's blocked by a second Bludger sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can't tell which nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes she's really flying dodges a speeding Bludger the goal posts are ahead come on, now, Angelina Keeper Bletchley dives misses GRYFFINDORS SCORE!\n"," Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins\n","Budge up there, move along\n","Hagrid!\n"," Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them\n","Bin watchin' from me hut,\n","But it isn't the same as bein' in the crowd\n"," No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?\n","Nope,\n","Harry hasn't had much to do yet\n","Kept outta trouble, though, that's somethin',\n"," Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch\n"," This was part of his and Wood's game plan\n","Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,\n","We don't want you attacked before you have to be\n"," When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings\n"," Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch\n"," Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys' wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it\n","All right there, Harry?\n"," he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint\n","Slytherin in possession,\n"," Lee Jordan was saying, \n","Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the wait a moment was that the Snitch?\n"," A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear\n"," Harry saw it\n"," In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold\n"," Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too\n"," Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch\n"," Harry was faster than Higgs he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead he put on an extra spurt of speed WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry's broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life\n","Foul!\n"," screamed the Gryffindors\n"," Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor\n"," But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again\n"," Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, \n","Send him off, ref! Red card!\n","What are you talking about, Dean?\n","Red card!\n","In soccer you get shown the red card and you're out of the game!\n","But this isn't soccer, Dean,\n"," Ron reminded him\n"," Hagrid, however, was on Dean's side\n","They oughta change the rules\n"," Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air\n"," Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides\n","So after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating \n","Jordan!\n"," growled Professor McGonagall\n","I mean, after that open and revolting foul \n","Jordan, I'm warning you \n","All right, all right\n"," Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession\n"," It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened\n"," His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch\n"," For a split second, he thought he was going to fall\n"," He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees\n"," He'd never felt anything like that\n"," It happened again\n"," It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off\n"," But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off\n"," Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal-posts he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control\n"," He couldn't turn it\n"," He couldn't direct it at all\n"," It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him\n"," Lee was still commentating\n","Slytherin in possession Flint with the Quaffle passes Spinnet passes Bell hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose only joking, Professor Slytherins score A no \n"," The Slytherins were cheering\n"," No one seemed to have noticed that Harry's broom was behaving strangely\n"," It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went\n","Dunno what Harry thinks he's doing,\n"," Hagrid mumbled\n"," He stared through his binoculars\n","If I didn' know better, I'd say he'd lost control of his broom but he can't have\n"," Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands\n"," His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on\n"," Then the whole crowd gasped\n"," Harry's broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it\n"," He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand\n","Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?\n","Can't have,\n","Can't nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand\n"," At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid's binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd\n","What are you doing?\n"," moaned Ron, gray-faced\n","I knew it,\n"," Hermione gasped, \n","Snape look\n"," Ron grabbed the binoculars\n"," Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them\n"," He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath\n","He's doing something jinxing the broom,\n","What should we do?\n","Leave it to me\n"," Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared\n"," Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry\n"," His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer\n"," The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good \\xe2\\x80\\x93 every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still\n"," They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell\n"," Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing\n","Come on, Hermione,\n"," Ron muttered desperately\n"," Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn't even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front\n"," Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape's robes\n"," It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire\n"," A sudden yelp told her she had done her job\n"," Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row Snape would never know what had happened\n"," It was enough\n"," Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom\n","Neville, you can look!\n"," Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid's jacket for the last five minutes\n"," Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick he hit the field on all fours coughed and something gold fell into his hand\n","I've got the Snitch!\n"," he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion\n","He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it,\n"," Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference Harry hadn't broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty\n"," Harry heard none of this, though\n"," He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid's hut, with Ron and Hermione\n","It was Snape,\n"," Ron was explaining, \n","Hermione and I saw him\n"," He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you\n","Rubbish,\n","Why would Snape do somethin' like that?\n"," Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him\n"," Harry decided on the truth\n","I found out something about him,\n"," he told Hagrid\n","He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween\n"," It bit him\n"," We think he was trying to steal whatever it's guarding\n"," Hagrid dropped the teapot\n","How do you know about Fluffy?\n","Fluffy?\n","Yeah he's mine bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las' year I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the \n","Yes?\n","Now, don't ask me anymore,\n","That's top secret, that is\n","But Snape's trying to steal it\n","Rubbish,\n","Snape's a Hogwarts teacher, he'd do nothin' of the sort\n","So why did he just try and kill Harry?\n"," cried Hermione\n"," The afternoon's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape\n","I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all about them! You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking at all, I saw him!\n","I'm tellin' yeh, yer wrong!\n","I don' know why Harry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh yer meddlin' in things that don' concern yeh\n"," It's dangerous\n"," You forget that dog, an' you forget what it's guardin', that's between Professor Dumbledore an' Nicolas Flamel \n","Aha!\n","so there's someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?\n"," Hagrid looked furious with himself\n"," C hristmas was coming\n"," One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow\n"," The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban\n"," The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again\n"," No one could wait for the holidays to start\n"," While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms\n"," Worst of all were Professor Snape's classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons\n","I do feel so sorry,\n","for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they're not wanted at home\n"," He was looking over at Harry as he spoke\n"," Crabbe and Goyle chuckled\n"," Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them\n"," Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match\n"," Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a widemouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next\n"," Then he'd realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick\n"," So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family\n"," It was true that Harry wasn't going back to Privet Drive for Christmas\n"," Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once\n"," He didn't feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he'd ever had\n"," Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr and Mrs Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie\n"," When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead\n"," Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it\n","Hi, Hagrid, want any help?\n","Nah, I'm all right, thanks, Ron\n","Would you mind moving out of the way?\n"," came Malfoy's cold drawl from behind them\n","Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley?\n"," Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose that hut of Hagrid's must seem like a palace compared to what your family's used to\n"," Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs\n","WEASLEY!\n"," Ron let go of the front of Malfoy's robes\n","He was provoked, Professor Snape,\n","Malfoy was insultin' his family\n","Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,\n","Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn't more\n"," Move along, all of you\n"," Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking\n","I'll get him,\n","one of these days, I'll get him \n","I hate them both,\n","Malfoy and Snape\n","Come on, cheer up, it's nearly Christmas,\n","Tell yeh what, come with me an' see the Great Hall, looks a treat\n"," So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations\n","Ah, Hagrid, the last tree put it in the far corner, would you?\n"," The hall looked spectacular\n"," Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles\n","How many days you got left until yer holidays?\n","Just one,\n","And that reminds me Harry, Ron, we've got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library\n","Oh yeah, you're right,\n","The library?\n","Just before the holidays?\n"," Bit keen, aren't yeh?\n","Oh, we're not working,\n"," Harry told him brightly\n","Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we've been trying to find out who he is\n","You what?\n"," Hagrid looked shocked\n","Listen here I've told yeh drop it\n"," It's nothin' to you what that dog's guardin'\n","We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all,\n","Unless you'd like to tell us and save us the trouble?\n"," Harry added\n","We must've been through hundreds of books already and we can't find him anywhere just give us a hint I know I've read his name somewhere\n","Just have to find out for ourselves, then,\n"," They had indeed been searching books for Flamel's name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal?\n"," The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book\n"," He wasn't in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry\n"," And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows\n"," Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random\n"," Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section\n"," He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn't somewhere in there\n"," Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he'd never get one\n"," These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts\n","What are you looking for, boy?\n","Nothing,\n"," Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him\n","You'd better get out, then\n"," Go on out!\n"," Wishing he'd been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library\n"," He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel\n"," They were sure she'd be able to tell them, but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were up to\n"," Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn't very hopeful\n"," They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising they'd found nothing\n"," What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks\n"," Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads\n"," They went off to lunch\n","You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?\n","And send me an owl if you find anything\n","And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\n","It'd be safe to ask them\n","Very safe, as they're both dentists,\n"," Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel\n"," They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire\n"," They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork bread, English muffins, marshmallows and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn't work\n"," Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess\n"," This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle\n"," Ron's set was very old and battered\n"," Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family in this case, his grandfather\n"," However, old chessmen weren't a drawback at all\n"," Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted\n"," Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn't trust him at all\n"," He wasn't a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing\n","Don't send me there, can't you see his knight?\n"," Send him, we can afford to lose him\n"," On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all\n"," When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed\n","Merry Christmas,\n","You, too,\n","Will you look at this?\n"," I've got some presents!\n","What did you expect, turnips?\n"," Harry picked up the top parcel\n"," It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid\n"," Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute\n"," Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself\n"," Harry blew it it sounded a bit like an owl\n"," A second, very small parcel contained a note\n"," We received your message and enclose your Christmas present\n"," From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia\n"," Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece\n","That's friendly,\n"," Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence\n","Weird!\n","You can keep it,\n","Hagrid and my aunt and uncle so who sent these?\n","I think I know who that one's from,\n","My mom\n"," I told her you didn't expect any presents and oh, no,\n"," he groaned, \n","she's made you a Weasley sweater\n"," Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge\n","Every year she makes us a sweater,\n","and mine's always maroon\n","That's really nice of her,\n"," His next present also contained candy a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione\n"," This only left one parcel\n"," Harry picked it up and felt it\n"," It was very light\n"," He unwrapped it\n"," Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds\n"," Ron gasped\n","I've heard of those,\n","If that's what I think it is they're really rare, and really valuable\n","What is it?\n"," Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor\n"," It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material\n","It's an invisibility cloak,\n","I'm sure it is try it on\n"," Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell\n","It is! Look down!\n"," Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone\n"," He dashed to the mirror\n"," Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible\n"," He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely\n","There's a note!\n","A note fell out of it!\n"," Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter\n"," Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words: Your father left this in my possession before he died\n"," It is time it was returned to you\n"," Use it well\n"," A Very Merry Christmas to you\n"," There was no signature\n"," Harry stared at the note\n"," Ron was admiring the cloak\n","I'd give anything for one of these,\n","Anything\n"," What's the matter?\n","Nothing,\n"," He felt very strange\n"," Who had sent the cloak?\n"," Had it really once belonged to his father?\n"," Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in\n"," Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight\n"," He didn't feel like sharing it with anyone else yet\n","Merry Christmas!\n","Hey, look Harry's got a Weasley sweater, too!\n"," Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G\n","Harry's is better than ours, though,\n","She obviously makes more of an effort if you're not family\n","Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?\n"," George demanded\n","Come on, get it on, they're lovely and warm\n","I hate maroon,\n"," Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head\n","You haven't got a letter on yours,\n"," George observed\n","I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name\n"," But we're not stupid we know we're called Gred and Forge\n","What's all this noise?\n"," Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving\n"," He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized\n","P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even Harry got one\n","I don't want \n","And you're not sitting with the prefects today, either,\n","Christmas is a time for family\n"," They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater\n"," Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner\n"," A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table\n"," These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside\n"," Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice\n"," Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him\n"," Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey\n"," Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice\n"," Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry's amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided\n"," When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set\n"," The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs Norris's Christmas dinner\n"," Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds\n"," Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron\n"," He suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help him so much\n"," After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge\n"," It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever\n"," Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day\n"," Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it\n"," Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he'd drawn the curtains of his four-poster\n"," Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it\n"," His father's this had been his father's\n"," He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air\n"," He had to try it, now\n"," He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself\n"," Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows\n"," It was a very funny feeling\n"," Use it well\n"," Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake\n"," The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak\n"," Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence\n"," He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know\n"," Ron grunted in his sleep\n"," Should Harry wake him?\n"," Something held him back his father's cloak he felt that this time the first time he wanted to use it alone\n"," He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole\n","Who's there?\n"," squawked the Fat Lady\n"," He walked quickly down the corridor\n"," Where should he go?\n"," He stopped, his heart racing, and thought\n"," And then it came to him\n"," The Restricted Section in the library\n"," He'd be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was\n"," He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked\n"," The library was pitch-black and very eerie\n"," Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books\n"," The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps\n"," The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library\n"," Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles\n"," They didn't tell him much\n"," Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn't understand\n"," Some had no title at all\n"," One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood\n"," The hairs on the back of Harry's neck prickled\n"," Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be\n"," He had to start somewhere\n"," Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book\n"," A large black and silver volume caught his eye\n"," He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open\n"," A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note\n"," He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once\n"," Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it\n"," He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears\n"," He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor\n"," He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going\n"," Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all\n"," There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there\n"," Harry felt the blood drain out of his face\n"," Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, \n","The Restricted Section?\n"," Well, they can't be far, we'll catch them\n"," Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead\n"," They couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him the cloak didn't stop him from being solid\n"," He backed away as quietly as he could\n"," A door stood ajar to his left\n"," It was his only hope\n"," He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything\n"," They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away\n"," That had been close, very close\n"," It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in\n"," It looked like an unused classroom\n"," The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way\n"," It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet\n"," There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi\n"," His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again\n"," He stepped in front of it\n"," He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming\n"," He whirled around\n"," His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him\n"," But the room was empty\n"," Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror\n"," There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others\n"," Harry looked over his shoulder but still, no one was there\n"," Or were they all invisible, too?\n"," Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?\n"," He looked in the mirror again\n"," A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving\n"," He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him\n"," If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air \\xe2\\x80\\x93 she and the others existed only in the mirror\n"," She was a very pretty woman\n"," She had dark red hair and her eyes her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass\n"," Bright green exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time\n"," The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her\n"," He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy\n"," It stuck up at the back, just as Harry's did\n"," Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection\n","Mom?\n","Dad?\n"," They just looked at him, smiling\n"," And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry's knobbly knees Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life\n"," The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them\n"," He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness\n"," How long he stood there, he didn't know\n"," The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses\n"," He couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed\n","I'll come back,\n"," and hurried from the room\n","You could have woken me up,\n","You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want to show you the mirror\n","I'd like to see your mom and dad,\n","And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone\n","You can see them any old time,\n","Just come round my house this summer\n"," Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people\n"," Shame about not finding Flamel, though\n"," Have some bacon or something, why aren't you eating anything?\n"," Harry couldn't eat\n"," He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight\n"," He had almost forgotten about Flamel\n"," It didn't seem very important anymore\n"," Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding?\n"," What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?\n","Are you all right?\n","You look odd\n"," What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again\n"," With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night\n"," They tried retracing Harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour\n","I'm freezing,\n","Let's forget it and go back\n","No!\n"," Harry hissed\n"," I know it's here somewhere\n"," They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else\n"," just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor\n","It's here just here yes!\n"," They pushed the door open\n"," Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror\n"," There they were\n"," His mother and father beamed at the sight of him\n","See?\n","I can't see anything\n","Look! Look at them all there are loads of them\n","I can only see you\n","Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am\n"," Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn't see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas\n"," Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image\n","Look at me!\n","Can you see all your family standing around you?\n","No I'm alone but I'm different I look older and I'm head boy!\n","What?\n","I am I'm wearing the badge like Bill used to and I'm holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup I'm Quidditch captain, too\n"," Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry\n","Do you think this mirror shows the future?\n","How can it?\n"," All my family are dead let me have another look \n","You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time\n","You're only holding the Quidditch cup, what's interesting about that?\n"," I want to see my parents\n","Don't push me \n"," A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion\n"," They hadn't realized how loudly they had been talking\n","Quick!\n"," Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs Norris came round the door\n"," Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing did the cloak work on cats?\n"," After what seemed an age, she turned and left\n","This isn't safe she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us\n"," Come on\n"," And Ron pulled Harry out of the room\n"," The snow still hadn't melted the next morning\n","Want to play chess, Harry?\n","No\n","Why don't we go down and visit Hagrid?\n","No you go \n","I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror\n"," Don't go back tonight\n","Why not?\n","I dunno, I've just got a bad feeling about it and anyway, you've had too many close shaves already\n"," Filch, Snape, and Mrs Norris are wandering around\n"," So what if they can't see you?\n"," What if they walk into you?\n"," What if you knock something over?\n","You sound like Hermione\n","I'm serious, Harry, don't go\n"," But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn't going to stop him\n"," That third night he found his way more quickly than before\n"," He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn't meet anyone\n"," And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily\n"," Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror\n"," There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family\n"," Nothing at all\n"," Except \n","So back again, Harry?\n"," Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice\n"," He looked behind him\n"," Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore\n"," Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn't noticed him\n","I I didn't see you, sir\n","Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,\n","So,\n","you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised\n","I didn't know it was called that, Sir\n","But I expect you've realized by now what it does?\n","It well it shows me my family \n","And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy\n","How did you know ?\n","I don't need a cloak to become invisible,\n","Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\n"," Harry shook his head\n","Let me explain\n"," The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is\n"," Does that help?\n"," Harry thought\n","It shows us what we want whatever we want \n","Yes and no,\n","It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts\n"," You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you\n"," Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them\n"," However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth\n"," Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible\n","The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again\n"," If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared\n"," It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that\n"," Now, why don't you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?\n"," Harry stood up\n","Sir Professor Dumbledore?\n"," Can I ask you something?\n","Obviously, you've just done so,\n"," Dumbledore smiled\n","You may ask me one more thing, however\n","What do you see when you look in the mirror?\n","I?\n"," I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks\n"," Harry stared\n","One can never have enough socks,\n","Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair\n"," People will insist on giving me books\n"," It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful\n"," But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question\n"," Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk\n"," Harry wished he could forget what he'd seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn't\n"," He started having nightmares\n"," Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter\n","You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,\n"," Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things\n"," She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (\n","If Filch had caught you!\n","), and disappointment that he hadn't at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was\n"," They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he'd read the name somewhere\n"," Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks\n"," Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again\n"," Wood was working the team harder than ever\n"," Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn't dampen his spirits\n"," The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood's side\n"," If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years\n"," Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training\n"," Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news\n"," He'd just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms\n","Will you stop messing around!\n"," he yelled\n","That's exactly the sort of thing that'll lose us the match! Snape's refereeing this time, and he'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!\n"," George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words\n","Snape's refereeing?\n"," he spluttered through a mouthful of mud\n","When's he ever refereed a Quidditch match?\n"," He's not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin\n"," The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too\n","It's not my fault,\n","We've just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn't got an excuse to pick on us\n"," Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch\n"," The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess\n"," Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her\n","Don't talk to me for a moment,\n","I need to concen \n"," He caught sight of Harry's face\n","What's the matter with you?\n"," You look terrible\n"," Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape's sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee\n","Don't play,\n","Say you're ill,\n","Pretend to break your leg,\n"," Hermione suggested\n","Really break your leg,\n","I can't,\n","There isn't a reserve Seeker\n"," If I back out, Gryffindor can't play at all\n"," At that moment Neville toppled into the common room\n"," How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse\n"," He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower\n"," Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse\n"," Neville's legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling\n","What happened?\n","Malfoy,\n","I met him outside the library\n","Go to Professor McGonagall!\n"," Hermione urged Neville\n","Report him!\n"," Neville shook his head\n","I don't want more trouble,\n"," he mumbled\n","You've got to stand up to him, Neville!\n","He's used to walking all over people, but that's no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier\n","There's no need to tell me I'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy's already done that,\n"," Neville choked out\n"," Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas\n"," He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry\n","You're worth twelve of Malfoy,\n","The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn't it?\n"," And where's Malfoy?\n"," In stinking Slytherin\n"," Neville's lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog\n","Thanks, Harry I think I'll go to bed\n"," D'you want the card, you collect them, don't you?\n"," As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card\n","Dumbledore again,\n","He was the first one I ever \n"," He gasped\n"," He stared at the back of the card\n"," Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione\n","I've found him!\n","I've found Flamel! I told you I'd read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here listen to this: Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel'!\n"," Hermione jumped to her feet\n"," She hadn't looked so excited since they'd gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework\n","Stay there!\n"," Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms\n","I never thought to look in here!\n","I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading\n","Light?\n"," At last she found what she was looking for\n","I knew it! I knew it!\n","Are we allowed to speak yet?\n"," Hermione ignored him\n","Nicolas Flamel,\n","is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's Stone!\n"," This didn't have quite the effect she'd expected\n","The what?\n","Oh, honestly, don't you two read?\n"," Look \\xe2\\x80\\x93 read that, there\n"," She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read: The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers\n"," The stone will transform any metal into pure gold\n"," It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal\n"," There have been many reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover\n"," Mr Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixtyfifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight)\n","See?\n","A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!\n","No wonder Snape's after it! Anyone would want it\n","And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,\n","He's not exactly recent if he's six hundred and sixty-five, is he?\n"," The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they'd do with a Sorcerer's Stone if they had one\n","I'm going to play,\n"," he told Ron and Hermione\n","If I don't, all the Slytherins will think I'm just too scared to face Snape\n"," I'll show them it'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win\n","Just as long as we're not wiping you off the field,\n"," As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione\n"," The rest of the team wasn't too calm, either\n"," The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?\n"," Harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went\n"," At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own\n"," Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry\n"," Could Snape possibly know they'd found out about the Sorcerer's Stone?\n"," Harry didn't see how he could yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds\n"," Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd ever see him alive again\n"," This wasn't what you'd call comforting\n"," Harry hardly heard a word of Wood's pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand\n"," Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match\n"," Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse\n"," They'd gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry\n","Now, don't forget, it's Locomotor Mortis,\n"," Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve\n","I know,\n"," Ron snapped\n","Don't nag\n"," Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside\n","Don't want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it's now\n"," Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much\n","The whole school's out there!\n","Even blimey Dumbledore's come to watch!\n"," Harry's heart did a somersault\n","Dumbledore?\n"," Fred was right\n"," There was no mistaking that silver beard\n"," Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe\n"," There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching\n"," Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too\n","I've never seen Snape look so mean,\n"," he told Hermione\n","Look they're off\n"," Ouch!\n"," Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head\n"," It was Malfoy\n","Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn't see you there\n"," Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle\n","Wonder how long Potter's going to stay on his broom this time?\n"," Anyone want a bet?\n"," What about you, Weasley?\n"," Ron didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him\n"," Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch\n","You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?\n","It's people they feel sorry for\n"," See, there's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's the Weasleys, who've got no money you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no brains\n"," Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy\n","I'm worth twelve of you, Malfoy,\n"," he stammered\n","You tell him, Neville\n","Longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than Weasley, and that's saying something\n"," Ron's nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry\n","I'm warning you, Malfoy one more word \n","Ron!\n","Harry \n","What?\n"," Where?\n"," Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd\n"," Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet\n","You're in luck, Weasley, Potter's obviously spotted some money on the ground!\n"," Ron snapped\n"," Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground\n"," Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help\n","Come on, Harry!\n"," Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape she didn't even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle\n"," Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand\n"," The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly\n","Ron! Ron! Where are you?\n"," The game's over! Harry's won! We've won! Gryffindor is in the lead!\n"," shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front\n"," Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground\n"," He couldn't believe it\n"," He'd done it the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes\n"," As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore's smiling face\n","Well done,\n","Nice to see you haven't been brooding about that mirror\n","been keeping busy\n","excellent\n"," Snape spat bitterly on the ground\n"," Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed\n"," He couldn't ever remember feeling happier\n"," He'd really done something to be proud of now \\xe2\\x80\\x93 no one could say he was just a famous name any more\n"," The evening air had never smelled so sweet\n"," He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed\n"," Harry had reached the shed\n"," He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun\n"," Gryffindor in the lead\n"," He'd done it, he'd shown Snape \n"," And speaking of Snape A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle\n"," Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest\n"," Harry's victory faded from his mind as he watched\n"," He recognized the figure's prowling walk\n"," Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner what was going on?\n"," Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off\n"," Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run\n"," He followed\n"," The trees were so thick he couldn't see where Snape had gone\n"," He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices\n"," He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree\n"," He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves\n"," Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn't alone\n"," Quirrell was there, too\n"," Harry couldn't make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever\n"," Harry strained to catch what they were saying\n"," d-don't know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus \n","Oh, I thought we'd keep this private,\n","Students aren't supposed to know about the Sorcerer's Stone, after all\n"," Harry leaned forward\n"," Quirrell was mumbling something\n"," Snape interrupted him\n","Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?\n","B-b-but Severus, I \n","You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\n","I-I don't know what you \n","You know perfectly well what I mean\n"," An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree\n"," He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, \n"," your little bit of hocus-pocus\n"," I'm waiting\n","B-but I d-d-don't \n","Very well,\n"," Snape cut in\n","We'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie\n"," He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing\n"," It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified\n","Harry, where have you been?\n"," Hermione squeaked\n","We won! You won! We won!\n"," shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back\n","And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He's still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he'll be all right talk about showing Slytherin! I've waiting for you in the common room, we're having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens\n","Never mind that now,\n","Let's find an empty room, you wait 'til you hear this\n"," He made sure Peeves wasn't inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he'd seen and heard\n","So we were right, it is the Sorcerer's Stone, and Snape's trying to force Quirrell to help him get it\n","So you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?\n","It'll be gone by next Tuesday,\n"," Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they'd thought\n"," In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn't look as though he'd cracked yet\n"," Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside\n"," Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe\n"," Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell's stutter\n"," Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer's Stone\n"," She had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes\n"," Harry and Ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same\n","Hermione, the exams are ages away\n","Ten weeks,\n"," Hermione snapped\n","That's not ages, that's like a second to Nicolas Flamel\n","But we're not six hundred years old,\n"," Ron reminded her\n","Anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it's an A\n","What am I studying for?\n"," Are you crazy?\n"," You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year?\n"," They're very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don't know what's gotten into me\n"," Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione\n"," They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren't nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones\n"," It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon's blood or practicing wand movements\n"," Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work\n","I'll never remember this,\n"," Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window\n"," It was the first really fine day they'd had in months\n"," The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming\n"," Harry, who was looking up \n","Dittany\n"," in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn't look up until he heard Ron say, \n","Hagrid! What are you doing in the library?\n"," Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back\n"," He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat\n","Jus' lookin',\n","An' what're you lot up ter?\n"," He looked suddenly suspicious\n","Yer not still lookin' fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?\n","Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,\n","And we know what that dog's guarding, it's a Sorcerer's St \n","Shhhh!\n"," Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening\n","Don' go shoutin' about it, what's the matter with yeh?\n","There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,\n","about what's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy \n","SHHHH!\n","Listen come an' see me later, I'm not promisin' I'll tell yeh anythin', mind, but don' go rabbitin' about it in here, students aren' s'pposed ter know\n"," They'll think I've told yeh \n","See you later, then,\n"," Hagrid shuffled off\n","What was he hiding behind his back?\n","Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?\n","I'm going to see what section he was in,\n"," He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table\n","Dragons!\n","Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons!

seemed, Quirrell's spell and how to get past Fluffy\n","You're the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy\n"," aren't you, Hagrid?\n","And you wouldn't tell anyone, would you?\n"," Not even one of the teachers?\n","Not a soul knows except me an' Dumbledore,\n","Well, that's something,\n"," Harry muttered to the others\n","Hagrid, can we have a window open?\n"," I'm boiling\n","Can't, Harry, sorry,\n"," Harry noticed him glance at the fire\n"," Harry looked at it, too\n","Hagrid what's that?\n"," But he already knew what it was\n"," In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg\n","Ah,\n","That's er \n","Where did you get it, Hagrid?\n","It must've cost you a fortune\n","Won it,\n","Las' night\n"," I was down in the village havin' a few drinks an' got into a game o' cards with a stranger\n"," Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest\n","But what are you going to do with it when it's hatched?\n","Well, I've bin doin' some readin',\n","Got this outta the library Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit it's a bit outta date, o' course, but it's all in here\n"," Keep the egg in the fire, cause their mothers breathe on I em, see, an' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o' brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour\n"," An' see here how ter recognize diff'rent eggs what I got there's a Norwegian Ridgeback\n"," They're rare, them\n"," He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn't\n","Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,\n"," But Hagrid wasn't listening\n"," He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire\n"," So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut\n","Wonder what it's like to have a peaceful life,\n"," Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting\n"," Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too\n"," It was driving them nuts\n"," Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid\n"," He had written only two words: It's hatching\n"," Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut\n"," Hermione wouldn't hear of it\n","Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?\n","We've got lessons, we'll get into trouble, and that's nothing to what Hagrid's going to be in when someone finds out what he's doing \n","Shut up!\n"," Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen\n"," How much had he heard?\n"," Harry didn't like the look on Malfoy's face at all\n"," Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid's with the other two during morning break\n"," When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest\n"," Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited\n","It's nearly out\n"," He ushered them inside\n"," The egg was lying on the table\n"," There were deep cracks in it\n"," Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it\n"," They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath\n"," All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open\n"," The baby dragon flopped onto the table\n"," It wasn't exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella\n"," Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes\n"," It sneezed\n"," A couple of sparks flew out of its snout\n","Isn't he beautiful?\n"," Hagrid murmured\n"," He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon's head\n"," It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs\n","Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!\n","Hagrid,\n","how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?\n"," Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face he leapt to his feet and ran to the window\n","What's the matter?\n","Someone was lookin' through the gap in the curtains it's a kid he's runnin' back up ter the school\n"," Harry bolted to the door and looked out\n"," Even at a distance there was no mistaking him\n"," Malfoy had seen the dragon\n"," Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy's face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous\n"," They spent most of their free time in Hagrid's darkened hut, trying to reason with him\n","Just let him go,\n"," Harry urged\n","Set him free\n","I can't,\n","He's too little\n"," He'd die\n"," They looked at the dragon\n"," It had grown three times in length in just a week\n"," Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils\n"," Hagrid hadn't been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy\n"," There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor\n","I've decided to call him Norbert,\n","He really knows me now, watch\n"," Norbert! Norbert! Where's Mommy?\n","He's lost his marbles,\n"," Ron muttered in Harry's ear\n","Hagrid,\n","give it two weeks and Norbert's going to be as long as your house\n"," Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment\n"," Hagrid bit his lip\n","I I know I can't keep him forever, but I can't jus' dump him, I can't\n"," Harry suddenly turned to Ron\n","Charlie\n","You're losing it, too,\n","I'm Ron, remember?\n","No Charlie your brother, Charlie\n"," In Romania\n"," Studying dragons\n"," We could send Norbert to him\n"," Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!\n","Brilliant!\n","How about it, Hagrid?\n"," And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to ask him\n"," The following week dragged by\n"," Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed\n"," The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open\n"," Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry's invisibility cloak\n"," He had been down at Hagrid's hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate\n","It bit me!\n","I'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a week\n"," I tell you, that dragon's the most horrible animal I've ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you'd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit\n"," When it bit me he told me off for frightening it\n"," And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby\n"," There was a tap on the dark window\n","It's Hedwig!\n","She'll have Charlie's answer!\n"," The three of them put their heads together to read the note\n"," Dear Ron, How are you?\n"," Thanks for the letter I'd be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won't be easy getting him here\n"," I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week\n"," Trouble is, they mustn't be seen carrying an illegal dragon\n"," Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday?\n"," They can meet you there and take him away while it's still dark\n"," Send me an answer as soon as possible\n"," Love, Charlie They looked at one another\n","We've got the invisibility cloak,\n","It shouldn't be too difficult \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert\n"," It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him\n"," Anything to get rid of Norbert and Malfoy\n"," There was a hitch\n"," By the next morning, Ron's bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size\n"," He didn't know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey would she recognize a dragon bite?\n"," By the afternoon, though, he had no choice\n"," The cut had turned a nasty shade of green\n"," It looked as if Norbert's fangs were poisonous\n"," Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed\n","It's not just my hand,\n","although that feels like it's about to fall off\n"," Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me\n"," He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me I've told her it was a dog, but I don't think she believes me I shouldn't have hit him at the Quidditch match, that's why he's doing this\n"," Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down\n","It'll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\n"," On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat\n","Midnight on Saturday!\n","Oh no oh no I've just remembered Charlie's letter was in that book Malfoy took, he's going to know we're getting rid of Norbert\n"," Harry and Hermione didn't get a chance to answer\n"," Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep\n","It's too late to change the plan now,\n"," Harry told Hermione\n","We haven't got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert\n"," We'll have to risk it\n"," And we have got the invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn't know about that\n"," They found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them\n","I won't let you in,\n"," he puffed\n","Norbert's at a tricky stage nothin' I can't handle\n"," When they told him about Charlie's letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg\n","Aargh! It's all right, he only got my boot jus' playin' he's only a baby, after all\n"," The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle\n"," Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn't come quickly enough\n"," They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn't been so worried about what they had to do\n"," It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid's hut because they'd had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis against the wall\n"," Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate\n","He's got lots o' rats an' some brandy fer the journey,\n","An' I've packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely\n"," From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off\n","Bye-bye, Norbert!\n"," Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves\n","Mommy will never forget you!\n"," How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew\n"," Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors\n"," UP another staircase, then another \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even one of Harry's shortcuts didn't make the work much easier\n","Nearly there!\n"," Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower\n"," Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate\n"," Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away\n"," A lamp flared\n"," Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear\n","Detention!\n"," she shouted\n","And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you \n","You don't understand, Professor\n"," Harry Potter's coming he's got a dragon!\n","What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!\n"," The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that\n"," Not until they'd stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again\n"," Hermione did a sort of jig\n","Malfoy's got detention! I could sing!\n","Don't,\n"," Harry advised her\n"," Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate\n"," About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness\n"," Charlie's friends were a cheery lot\n"," They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them\n"," They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much\n"," At last, Norbert was going going gone\n"," They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them\n"," No more dragon Malfoy in detention what could spoil their happiness?\n"," The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs\n"," As they stepped into the corridor, Filch's face loomed suddenly out of the darkness\n","Well, well, well,\n","we are in trouble\n"," They'd left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower\n"," Things couldn't have been worse\n"," Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall's study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other\n"," Hermione was trembling\n"," Excuses, alibis, and wild cover- up stories chased each other around Harry's brain, each more feeble than the last\n"," He couldn't see how they were going to get out of trouble this time\n"," They were cornered\n"," How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak?\n"," There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes\n"," Add Norbert and the invisibility cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already\n"," Had Harry thought that things couldn't have been worse?\n"," He was wrong\n"," When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville\n","Harry!\n"," Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two\n"," Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen\n"," She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them\n","I would never have believed it of any of you\n"," Mr Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower\n"," It's one o'clock in the morning\n"," Explain yourselves\n"," It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher's question\n"," She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue\n","I think I've got a good idea of what's been going on,\n","It doesn't take a genius to work it out\n"," You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble\n"," I've already caught him\n"," I suppose you think it's funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?\n"," Harry caught Neville's eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn't true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt\n"," Poor, blundering Neville Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them\n","I'm disgusted,\n","Four students out of bed in one night! I've never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense\n"," As for you, Mr Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this\n"," All three of you will receive detentions yes, you too, Mr Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it's very dangerous and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor\n","Fifty?\n"," Harry gasped they would lose the lead, the lead he'd won in the last Quidditch match\n","Fifty points each,\n","Professor please \n","You can't \n","Don't tell me what I can and can't do, Potter\n"," Now get back to bed, all of you\n"," I've never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students\n"," A hundred and fifty points lost\n"," That put Gryffindor in last place\n"," In one night, they'd ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup\n"," Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach\n"," How could they ever make up for this?\n"," Harry didn't sleep all night\n"," He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours\n"," Harry couldn't think of anything to say to comfort him\n"," He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn\n"," What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they'd done?\n"," At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there'd been a mistake\n"," How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday?\n"," And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years\n"," From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated\n"," Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup\n"," Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn't trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him\n"," Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, \n","Thanks Potter, we owe you one!\n"," Only Ron stood by him\n","They'll all forget this in a few weeks\n"," Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they've been here, and people still like them\n","They've never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?\n","Well no,\n"," Ron admitted\n"," It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren't his business from now on\n"," He'd had it with sneaking around and spying\n"," He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team\n","Resign?\n"," Wood thundered\n","What good'll that do?\n"," How are we going to get any points back if we can't win at Quidditch?\n"," But even Quidditch had lost its fun\n"," The rest of the team wouldn't speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him \n","the Seeker\n"," Hermione and Neville were suffering, too\n"," They didn't have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren't as well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either\n"," Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence\n"," Harry was almost glad that the exams weren't far away\n"," All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery\n"," He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions\n"," Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry's new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn't concern him was put to an unexpected test\n"," Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead\n"," As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell's voice\n","No no not again, please \n"," It sounded as though someone was threatening him\n"," Harry moved closer\n","All right all right \n"," he heard Quirrell sob\n"," Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban\n"," He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry\n"," He strode out of sight; Harry didn't think Quirrell had even noticed him\n"," He waited until Quirrell's footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom\n"," It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end\n"," Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he'd promised himself about not meddling\n"," All the same, he'd have gambled twelve Sorcerer's Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step Quirrell seemed to have given in at last\n"," Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy\n"," Harry told them what he'd heard\n","Snape's done it, then!\n","If Quirrell's told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell \n","There's still Fluffy, though,\n","Maybe Snape's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,\n","I bet there's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog\n"," So what do we do, Harry?\n"," The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron's eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could\n","Go to Dumbledore\n"," That's what we should have done ages ago\n"," If we try anything ourselves we'll be thrown out for sure\n","But we've got no proof!\n","Quirrell's too scared to back us up\n"," Snape's only got to say he doesn't know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor who do you think they'll believe, him or us?\n"," It's not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore'll think we made it up to get him sacked\n"," Filch wouldn't help us if his life depended on it, he's too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he'll think\n"," And don't forget, we're not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy\n"," That'll take a lot of explaining\n"," Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn't\n","If we just do a bit of poking around \n","No,\n","we've done enough poking around\n"," He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons\n"," The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table\n"," They were all the same: Your detention will take place at eleven o'clock tonight\n"," Meet Mr Filch in the entrance hall\n"," Professor McGonagall Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they'd lost\n"," He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn't say a word\n"," Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they'd got\n"," Filch was already there and so was Malfoy\n"," Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too\n","Follow me,\n","I bet you'll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won't you, eh?\n","Oh yes hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me \n","It's just a pity they let the old punishments die out hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I've got the chains still in my office, keep em well oiled in case they're ever needed Right, off we go, and don't think of running off, now, it'll be worse for you if you do\n"," They marched off across the dark grounds\n"," Neville kept sniffing\n"," Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be\n"," It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted\n"," The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness\n"," Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid's hut\n"," Then they heard a distant shout\n","Is that you, Filch?\n"," Hurry up, I want ter get started\n"," Harry's heart rose;

everyone says Dumbledore's the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of with Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won't touch you\n"," Anyway, who says the centaurs are right?\n"," It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that's a very imprecise branch of magic\n"," The sky had turned light before they stopped talking\n"," They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore\n"," But the night's surprises weren't over\n"," When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them\n"," There was a note pinned to it: Just in case\n"," In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment\n"," Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door\n"," It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers\n"," They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anticheating spell\n"," They had practical exams as well\n"," Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk\n"," Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers\n"," Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion\n"," Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest\n"," Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn't sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it\n"," Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn't have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn't seem as worried about the Stone as Harry\n"," The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn't have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to\n"," Their very last exam was History of Magic\n"," One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who'd invented selfstirring cauldrons and they'd be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out\n"," When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help cheering with the rest\n","That was far easier than I thought it would be,\n","I needn't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager\n"," The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows\n","No more studying,\n"," Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass\n","You could look more cheerful, Harry, we've got a week before we find out how badly we've done, there's no need to worry yet\n"," Harry was rubbing his forehead\n","I wish I knew what this means!\n"," he burst out angrily\n","My scar keeps hurting it's happened before, but never as often as this\n","Go to Madam Pomfrey,\n"," Hermione suggested\n","I'm not ill,\n","I think it's a warning it means danger's coming \n"," Ron couldn't get worked up, it was too hot\n","Harry, relax, Hermione's right, the Stone's safe as long as Dumbledore's around\n"," Anyway, we've never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy\n"," He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not going to try it again in a hurry\n"," And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down\n"," Harry nodded, but he couldn't shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten to do, something important\n","That's just the exams\n"," I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we'd done that one\n"," Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn't have anything to do with work, though\n"," He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth\n"," Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters\n"," Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore\n"," Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy never but \n"," Harry suddenly jumped to his feet\n","Where're you going?\n","I've just thought of something,\n"," He had turned white\n","We've got to go and see Hagrid, now\n","Why?\n"," panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up\n","Don't you think it's a bit odd,\n","that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket?\n"," How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it's against wizard law?\n"," Lucky they found Hagrid, don't you think?\n"," Why didn't I see it before?\n","What are you talking about?\n"," Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl\n","Hullo,\n","Finished yer exams?\n"," Got time fer a drink?\n","Yes, please,\n","No, we're in a hurry\n"," Hagrid, I've got to ask you something\n"," You know that night you won Norbert?\n"," What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?\n","Dunno,\n","he wouldn' take his cloak off\n"," He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows\n","It's not that unusual, yeh get a lot o' funny folk in the Hog's Head that's the pub down in the village\n"," Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn' he?\n"," I never saw his face, he kept his hood up\n"," Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas\n","What did you talk to him about, Hagrid?\n"," Did you mention Hogwarts at all?\n","Mighta come up,\n","So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy\n","And did he did he seem interested in Fluffy?\n","Well yeah how many three-headed dogs d'yeh meet, even around Hogwarts?\n"," So I told him, Fluffy's a piece o' cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus' play him a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off ter sleep \n"," Hagrid suddenly looked horrified\n","I shouldn'ta told yeh that!\n"," he blurted out\n"," Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn't speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds\n","We've got to go to Dumbledore,\n","Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak it must've been easy, once he'd got Hagrid drunk\n"," I just hope Dumbledore believes us\n"," Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn't stop him\n"," Where's Dumbledore's office?\n"," They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction\n"," They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him\n","We'll just have to \n"," Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall\n","What are you three doing inside?\n"," It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books\n","We want to see Professor Dumbledore,\n","See Professor Dumbledore?\n"," Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do\n","Why?\n"," Harry swallowed now what?\n","It's sort of secret,\n","Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\n","He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once\n","He's gone?\n","Now?\n","Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \n","But this is important\n","Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?\n","Look,\n","Professor it's about the Sorcerer's Stone \n"," Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that\n"," The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn't pick them up\n","How do you know ?\n"," she spluttered\n","Professor, I think I know that Sn that someone's going to try and steal the Stone\n"," I've got to talk to Professor Dumbledore\n"," She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion\n","Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\n"," I don't know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it's too well protected\n","But Professor \n","Potter, I know what I'm talking about,\n"," She bent down and gathered up the fallen books\n"," I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine\n"," But they didn't\n","It's tonight,\n","Snape's going through the trapdoor tonight\n"," He's found out everything he needs, and now he's got Dumbledore out of the way\n"," He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up\n","But what can we \n"," Hermione gasped\n"," Harry and Ron wheeled round\n"," Snape was standing there\n","Good afternoon,\n"," They stared at him\n","You shouldn't be inside on a day like this,\n","We were \n"," Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say\n","You want to be more careful,\n","Hanging around like this, people will think you're up to something\n"," And Gryffindor really can't afford to lose any more points, can it?\n"," Harry flushed\n"," They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back\n","Be warned, Potter any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled\n"," Good day to you\n"," He strode off in the direction of the staffroom\n"," Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others\n","Right, here's what we've got to do,\n","One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it\n"," Hermione, you'd better do that\n","Why me?\n","It's obvious,\n","You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know\n"," He put on a high voice, \n"," Oh Professor Flitwick, I'm so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong \n","'\n","Oh, shut up,\n","And we'd better stay outside the third-floor corridor,\n"," Harry told Ron\n","Come on\n"," But that part of the plan didn't work\n"," No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper\n","I suppose you think you're harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!\n"," she stormed\n","Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you've come anywhere near here again, I'll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!\n","At least Hermione's on Snape's tail,\n"," when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in\n","I'm sorry, Harry!\n"," she wailed\n","Well, that's it then, isn't it?\n"," The other two stared at him\n"," He was pale and his eyes were glittering\n","I'm going out of here tonight and I'm going to try and get to the Stone first\n","You're mad!\n","You can't!\n","SO WHAT\n"," Harry shouted\n","Don't you understand?\n"," If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort's coming back! Haven't you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over?\n"," There won't be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He'll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn't matter anymore, can't you see?\n"," D'you think he'll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup?\n"," If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I'll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it's only dying a bit later than I would have, because I'm never going over to the Dark Side! I'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\n"," He glared at them\n","You're right Harry,\n","I'll use the invisibility cloak,\n","It's just lucky I got it back\n","But will it cover all three of us?\n","All all three of us?\n","Oh, come off it, you don't think we'd let you go alone?\n","Of course not,\n","How do you think you'd get to the Stone without us?\n"," I'd better go and took through my books, there might be something useful \n","But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too\n","Not if I can help it,\n","Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam\n"," They're not throwing me out after that\n"," After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room\n"," Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all\n"," This was the first night he hadn't been upset by it\n"," Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break\n"," Harry and Ron didn't talk much\n"," Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do\n"," Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed\n","Better get the cloak,\n"," Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning\n"," Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory\n"," He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas\n"," He pocketed it to use on Fluffy he didn't feel much like singing\n"," He ran back down to the common room\n","We'd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own \n","What are you doing?\n"," Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he'd been making another bid for freedom\n","Nothing, Neville, nothing,\n"," Neville stared at their guilty faces\n","You're going out again,\n","No, no, no,\n","No, we're not\n"," Why don't you go to bed, Neville?\n"," Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door\n"," They couldn't afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep\n","You can't go out,\n","you'll be caught again\n"," Gryffindor will be in even more trouble\n","You don't understand,\n","this is important\n"," But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate\n"," I won't let you do it,\n","I'll I'll fight you!\n","Neville, \n","Ron exploded, \n","get away from that hole and don't be an idiot \n","Don't you call me an idiot!\n"," I don't think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!\n","Yes, but not to us,\n","Neville, you don't know what you're doing\n"," He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight\n","Go on then, try and hit me!\n","I'm ready!\n"," Harry turned to Hermione\n","Do something,\n"," Hermione stepped forward\n","Neville,\n","I'm really, really sorry about this\n"," She raised her wand\n","Petrificus Totalus!\n"," she cried, pointing it at Neville\n"," Neville's arms snapped to his sides\n"," His legs sprang together\n"," His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board\n"," Hermione ran to turn him over\n"," Neville's jaws were jammed together so he couldn't speak\n"," Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror\n","What've you done to him?\n","It's the full Body-Bind,\n","Oh, Neville, I'm so sorry\n","We had to, Neville, no time to explain,\n","You'll understand later, Neville,\n"," But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn't feel like a very good omen\n"," In their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them\n"," At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs Norris skulking near the top\n","Oh, let's kick her, just this once,\n"," As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn't do anything\n"," They didn't meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor\n"," Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip\n","Who's there?\n"," He narrowed his wicked black eyes\n","Know you're there, even if I can't see you\n"," Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\n"," He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them\n","Should call Filch, I should, if something's a-creeping around unseen\n"," Harry had a sudden idea\n","Peeves,\n","the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible\n"," Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock\n"," He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs\n","So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr Baron, Sir,\n","My mistake, my mistake I didn't see you of course I didn't, you're invisible forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir\n","I have business here, Peeves,\n"," croaked Harry\n","Stay away from this place tonight\n","I will, sir, I most certainly will,\n","Hope your business goes well, Baron, I'll not bother you\n"," And he scooted off\n","Brilliant, Harry!\n"," A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor and the door was already ajar\n","Well, there you are,\n","Snape's already got past Fluffy\n"," Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them\n"," Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two\n","If you want to go back, I won't blame you,\n","You can take the cloak, I won't need it now\n","Don't be stupid,\n","We're coming,\n"," Harry pushed the door open\n"," As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears\n"," All three of the dog's noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn't see them\n","What's that at its feet?\n","Looks like a harp,\n","Snape must have left it there\n","It must wake up the moment you stop playing,\n","Well, here goes \n"," He put Hagrid's flute to his lips and blew\n"," It wasn't really a tune, but from the first note the beast's eyes began to droop\n"," Harry hardly drew breath\n"," Slowly, the dog's growls ceased it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep\n","Keep playing,\n"," Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor\n"," They could feel the dog's hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads\n","I think we'll be able to pull the door open,\n","Want to go first, Hermione?\n","No, I don't!\n","All right\n"," Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog's legs\n"," He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open\n","What can you see?\n","Nothing just black there's no way of climbing down, we'll just have to drop\n"," Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself\n","You want to go first?\n"," Are you sure?\n","I don't know how deep this thing goes\n"," Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep\n"," Harry handed the flute over\n"," In the few seconds' silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep\n"," Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor\n"," There was no sign of the bottom\n"," He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips\n","If anything happens to me, don't follow\n"," Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?\n","Right,\n","See you in a minute, I hope \n"," And Harry let go\n"," Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and FLUMP\n"," With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft\n"," He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom\n"," It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant\n","It's okay!\n"," he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, \n","it's a soft landing, you can jump!\n"," Ron followed right away\n"," He landed, sprawled next to Harry\n","What's this stuff?\n"," were his first words\n","Dunno, some sort of plant thing\n"," I suppose it's here to break the fall\n"," Come on, Hermione!\n"," The distant music stopped\n"," There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped\n"," She landed on Harry's other side\n","We must be miles under the school,\n","Lucky this plant thing's here, really,\n","Lucky!\n"," shrieked Hermione\n","Look at you both!\n"," She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall\n"," She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles\n"," As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing\n"," Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her\n"," Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them\n","Stop moving!\n"," Hermione ordered them\n","I know what this is it's Devil's Snare!\n","Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's a great help,\n"," snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck\n","Shut up, I'm trying to remember how to kill it!\n","Well, hurry up, I can't breathe!\n"," Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest\n","Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare what did Professor Sprout say?\n"," it likes the dark and the damp\n","So light a fire!\n"," Harry choked\n","Yes of course but there's no wood!\n"," Hermione cried, wringing her hands\n","HAVE YOU GONE MAD?\n"," Ron bellowed\n","ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?\n","Oh, right!\n"," In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth\n"," Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free\n","Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\n","Yeah,\n","and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head in a crisis there's no wood,' honestly\n","This way,\n"," All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls\n"," The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts\n"," If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon Norbert had been bad enough \n","Can you hear something?\n"," Harry listened\n"," A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead\n","Do you think it's a ghost?\n","I don't know sounds like wings to me\n","There's light ahead I can see something moving\n"," They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them\n"," It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room\n"," On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door\n","Do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room?\n","Probably,\n","They don't look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once well, there's no other choice I'll run\n"," He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room\n"," He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened\n"," He reached the door untouched\n"," He pulled the handle, but it was locked\n"," The other two followed him\n"," They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm\n","Now what?\n","These birds they can't be here just for decoration,\n"," They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering glittering?\n","They're not birds!\n","They're keys! Winged keys look carefully\n"," So that must mean \n"," he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys\n"," yes look! Broomsticks! We've got to catch the key to the door!\n","But there are hundreds of them!\n"," Ron examined the lock on the door\n","We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one probably silver, like the handle\n"," They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys\n"," They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one\n"," Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century\n"," He had a knack for spotting things other people didn't\n"," After a minute's weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole\n","That one!\n"," he called to the others\n","That big one there no, there with bright blue wings the feathers are all crumpled on one side\n"," Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom\n","We've got to close in on it!\n"," Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing\n","Ron, you come at it from above Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I'll try and catch it\n"," Right, NOW!\n"," Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand\n"," Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around the high chamber\n"," They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand\n"," He rammed it into the lock and turned \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it worked\n"," The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice\n","Ready?\n"," They nodded\n"," He pulled the door open\n"," The next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything at all\n"," But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight\n"," They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone\n"," Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces\n"," Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the towering white chessmen had no faces\n","Now what do we do?\n","It's obvious, isn't it?\n","We've got to play our way across the room\n"," Behind the white pieces they could see another door\n","How?\n","I think,\n","we're going to have to be chessmen\n"," He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight's horse\n"," At once, the stone sprang to life\n"," The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron\n","Do we er have to join you to get across?\n"," The black knight nodded\n"," Ron turned to the other two\n","This needs thinking about \n","I suppose we've got to take the place of three of the black pieces \n"," Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think\n","Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess \n","We're not offended,\n","Just tell us what to do\n","Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you next to him instead of that castle\n","What about you?\n","I'm going to be a knight,\n"," The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took\n","White always plays first in chess,\n","Yes look \n"," A white pawn had moved forward two squares\n"," Ron started to direct the black pieces\n"," They moved silently wherever he sent them\n"," Harry's knees were trembling\n"," What if they lost?\n","Harry move diagonally four squares to the right\n"," Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken\n"," The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown\n","Had to let that happen,\n","Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on\n"," Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy\n"," Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall\n"," Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger\n"," He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones\n","We're nearly there,\n"," he muttered suddenly\n","Let me think let me think \n"," The white queen turned her blank face toward him\n","Yes \n","It's the only way I've got to be taken\n","NO!\n"," Harry and Hermione shouted\n","That's chess!\n"," snapped Ron\n","You've got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she'll take me that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!\n","But \n","Do you want to stop Snape or not?\n","Ron \n","Look, if you don't hurry up, he'll already have the Stone!\n"," There was no alternative\n","Ready?\n"," Ron called, his face pale but determined\n","Here I go now, don't hang around once you've won\n"," He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced\n"," She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor Hermione screamed but stayed on her square the white queen dragged Ron to one side\n"," He looked as if he'd been knocked out\n"," Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left\n"," The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry's feet\n"," They had won\n"," The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear\n"," With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway\n","What if he's ?\n","He'll be all right,\n","What do you reckon's next?\n","We've had Sprout's, that was the Devil's Snare; Flitwick must've put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell's spell, and Snape's\n"," They had reached another door\n","All right?\n","Go on\n"," Harry pushed it open\n"," A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses\n"," Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head\n","I'm glad we didn't have to fight that one,\n","Come on, I can't breathe\n"," He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next - but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line\n","Snape's,\n","What do we have to do?\n"," They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway\n"," It wasn't ordinary fire either; it was purple\n"," At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward\n"," They were trapped\n","Look!\n"," Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles\n"," Harry looked over her shoulder to read it: Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind, Two of us will help you, which ever you would find, One among us seven will let you move ahead, Another will transport the drinker back instead, Two among our number hold only nettle wine, Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line\n"," Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore, To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: First, however slyly the poison tries to hide You will always find some on nettle wine's left side; Second, different are those who stand at either end, But if you would move onward, neither is your friend; Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; Fourth, the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight\n"," Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing\n","Brilliant,\n","This isn't magic it's logic a puzzle\n"," A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here forever\n","But so will we, won't we?\n","Of course not,\n","Everything we need is here on this paper\n"," Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple\n","But how do we know which to drink?\n","Give me a minute\n"," Hermione read the paper several times\n"," Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them\n"," At last, she clapped her hands\n","Got it,\n","The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire toward the Stone\n"," Harry looked at the tiny bottle\n","There's only enough there for one of us,\n","That's hardly one swallow\n"," They looked at each other\n","Which one will get you back through the purple flames?\n"," Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line\n","You drink that,\n","No, listen, get back and get Ron\n"," Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they'll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him\n"," I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I'm no match for him, really\n","But Harry what if You-Know-Who's with him?\n","Well I was lucky once, wasn't I?\n","I might get lucky again\n"," Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him\n","Hermione!\n","Harry you're a great wizard, you know\n","I'm not as good as you,\n","Me!\n","Books! And cleverness! There are more important things friendship and bravery and oh Harry be careful!\n","You drink first,\n","You are sure which is which, aren't you?\n","Positive,\n"," She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered\n","It's not poison?\n","No but it's like ice\n","Quick, go, before it wears off\n","Good luck take care\n","GO!\n"," Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire\n"," Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle\n"," He turned to face the black flames\n","Here I come,\n"," It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body\n"," He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn't feel them for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire then he was on the other side, in the last chamber\n"," There was already someone there but it wasn't Snape\n"," It wasn't even Voldemort\n"," It was Quirrell\n","You!\n"," gasped Harry\n"," Quirrell smiled\n"," His face wasn't twitching at all\n","Me,\n","I wondered whether I'd be meeting you here, Potter\n","But I thought Snape \n","Severus?\n"," Quirrell laughed, and it wasn't his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp\n","Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn't he?\n"," So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat\n"," Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?\n"," Harry couldn't take it in\n"," This couldn't be true, it couldn't\n","But Snape tried to kill me!\n","No, no, no\n"," I tried to kill you\n"," Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match\n"," She broke my eye contact with you\n"," Another few seconds and I'd have got you off that broom\n"," I'd have managed it before then if Snape hadn't been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you\n","Snape was trying to save me?\n","Of course,\n","Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match?\n"," He was trying to make sure I didn't do it again\n"," Funny, really he needn't have bothered\n"," I couldn't do anything with Dumbledore watching\n"," All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular and what a waste of time, when after all that, I'm going to kill you tonight\n"," Quirrell snapped his fingers\n"," Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry\n","You're too nosy to live, Potter\n"," Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you'd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone\n","You let the troll in?\n","Certainly\n"," I have a special gift with trolls you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there?\n"," Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off properly\n","Now, wait quietly, Potter\n"," I need to examine this interesting mirror\n"," It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell\n"," It was the Mirror of Erised\n","This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\n"," Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame\n","Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this but he's in London I'll be far away by the time he gets back \n"," All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror\n","I saw you and Snape in the forest \n"," he blurted out\n","Yes,\n","He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I'd got\n"," He suspected me all along\n"," Tried to frighten me as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side \n"," Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it\n","I see the Stone I'm presenting it to my master but where is it?\n"," Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn't give\n"," He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror\n","But Snape always seemed to hate me so much\n","Oh, he does,\n","heavens, yes\n"," He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn't you know?\n"," They loathed each other\n"," But he never wanted you dead\n","But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing I thought Snape was threatening you\n"," For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell's face\n","Sometimes,\n","I find it hard to follow my master's instructions he is a great wizard and I am weak \n","You mean he was there in the classroom with you?\n"," Harry gasped\n","He is with me wherever I go,\n","I met him when I traveled around the world\n"," A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil\n"," Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was\n"," There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times\n"," He has had to be very hard on me\n"," Quirrell shivered suddenly\n","He does not forgive mistakes easily\n"," When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased\n"," He punished me decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me\n"," Quirrell's voice trailed away\n"," Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley how could he have been so stupid?\n"," He'd seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron\n"," Quirrell cursed under his breath\n","I don't understand is the Stone inside the mirror?\n"," Should I break it?\n"," Harry's mind was racing\n"," What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does\n"," So if I look in the mirror, I should see myself finding it which means I'll see where it's hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I'm up to?\n"," He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over\n"," Quirrell ignored him\n"," He was still talking to himself\n","What does this mirror do?\n"," How does it work?\n"," Help me, Master!\n"," And to Harry's horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself\n","Use the boy Use the boy\n"," Quirrell rounded on Harry\n","Yes Potter come here\n"," He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off\n"," Harry got slowly to his feet\n","Come here,\n"," Quirrell repeated\n","Look in the mirror and tell me what you see\n"," Harry walked toward him\n"," I must lie, he thought desperately\n"," I must look and lie about what I see, that's all\n"," Quirrell moved close behind him\n"," Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell's turban\n"," He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again\n"," He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first\n"," But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him\n"," It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone\n"," It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket\n"," Somehow incredibly he'd gotten the Stone\n","Well?\n","What do you see?\n"," Harry screwed up his courage\n","I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\n"," he invented\n","I I've won the house cup for Gryffindor\n"," Quirrell cursed again\n","Get out of the way,\n"," As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer's Stone against his leg\n"," Dare he make a break for it?\n"," But he hadn't walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn't moving his lips\n","He lies He lies\n","Potter, come back here!\n"," Quirrell shouted\n","Tell me the truth! What did you just see?\n"," The high voice spoke again\n","Let me speak to him face-to-face \n","Master, you are not strong enough!\n","I have strength enough for this \n"," Harry felt as if Devil's Snare was rooting him to the spot\n"," He couldn't move a muscle\n"," Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban\n"," What was going on?\n"," The turban fell away\n"," Quirrell's head looked strangely small without it\n"," Then he turned slowly on the spot\n"," Harry would have screamed, but he couldn't make a sound\n"," Where there should have been a back to Quirrell's head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen\n"," It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake\n","Harry Potter \n"," Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn't move\n","See what I have become?\n","Mere shadow and vapor \n","I have form only when I can share another's body but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my own \n","Now why don't you give me that Stone in your pocket?\n"," So he knew\n"," The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry's legs\n"," He stumbled backward\n","Don't be a fool,\n"," snarled the face\n","Better save your own life and join me or you'll meet the same end as your parents They died begging me for mercy \n","LIAR!\n"," Harry shouted suddenly\n"," Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him\n"," The evil face was now smiling\n","How touching \n"," it hissed\n","I always value bravery \n","Yes, boy, your parents were brave I killed your father first; and he put up a courageous fight but your mother needn't have died she was trying to protect you Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain\n","NEVER!\n"," Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed \n","SEIZE HIM!\n"," and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell's hand close on his wrist\n"," At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry's scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him\n"," The pain in his head lessened he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers they were blistering before his eyes\n","Seize him! SEIZE HIM!\n"," shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet landing on top of him, both hands around Harry's neck Harry's scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony\n","Master, I cannot hold him my hands my hands!\n"," And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny\n","Then kill him, fool, and be done!\n"," screeched Voldemort\n"," Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell's face \n","AAAARGH!\n"," Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse\n"," Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could\n"," Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off the pain in Harry's head was building he couldn't see he could only hear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Voldemort's yells of, \n","KILL HIM! KILL HIM!\n"," and other voices, maybe in Harry's own head, crying, \n","Harry! Harry!\n"," He felt Quirrell's arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down down down \n"," Something gold was glinting just above him\n"," The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy\n"," He blinked\n"," It wasn't the Snitch at all\n"," It was a pair of glasses\n"," How strange\n"," He blinked again\n"," The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him\n","Good afternoon, Harry,\n"," Harry stared at him\n"," Then he remembered: \n","Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He's got the Stone! Sir, quick \n","Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,\n","Quirrell does not have the Stone\n","Then who does?\n"," Sir, I \n","Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out\n"," Harry swallowed and looked around him\n"," He realized he must be in the hospital wing\n"," He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop\n","Tokens from your friends and admirers,\n","What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows\n"," I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat\n"," No doubt they thought it would amuse you\n"," Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it\n","How long have I been in here?\n","Three days\n"," Mr Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried\n","But sir, the Stone \n","I see you are not to be distracted\n"," Very well, the Stone\n"," Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you\n"," I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say\n","You got there?\n"," You got Hermione's owl?\n","We must have crossed in midair\n"," No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left\n"," I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you\n","It was you\n","I feared I might be too late\n","You nearly were, I couldn't have kept him off the Stone much longer \\xe2\\x80\\x93\n","Not the Stone, boy, you the effort involved nearly killed you\n"," For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had\n"," As for the Stone, it has been destroyed\n","Destroyed?\n","But your friend Nicolas Flamel \n","Oh, you know about Nicolas?\n","You did do the thing properly, didn't you?\n"," Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it's all for the best\n","But that means he and his wife will die, won't they?\n","They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die\n"," Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry's face\n","To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day\n"," After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure\n"," You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing\n"," As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them\n"," Harry lay there, lost for words\n"," Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling\n","Sir?\n","I've been thinking sir even if the Stone's gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who \n","Call him Voldemort, Harry\n"," Always use the proper name for things\n"," Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself\n","Yes, sir\n"," Well, Voldemort's going to try other ways of coming back, isn't he?\n"," I mean, he hasn't gone, has he?\n","No, Harry, he has not\n"," He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share not being truly alive, he cannot be killed\n"," He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies\n"," Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power\n"," Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt\n","Sir, there are some other things I'd like to know, if you can tell me things I want to know the truth about\n","The truth\n"," Dumbledore sighed\n","It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution\n"," However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you'll forgive me\n"," I shall not, of course, lie\n"," But why would he want to kill me in the first place?\n"," Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time\n","Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you\n"," Not today\n"," Not now\n"," You will know, one day put it from your mind for now, Harry\n"," When you are older I know you hate to hear this when you are ready, you will know\n"," And Harry knew it would be no good to argue\n","But why couldn't Quirrell touch me?\n","Your mother died to save you\n"," If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love\n"," He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark\n"," Not a scar, no visible sign to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever\n"," It is in your very skin\n"," Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason\n"," It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good\n"," Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet\n","And the invisibility cloak do you know who sent it to me?\n","Ah your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it\n"," Dumbledore's eyes twinkled\n","Useful things your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here\n","And there's something else \n","Fire away\n","Professor Snape, Harry\n"," Is that true?\n","Well, they did rather detest each other\n"," Not unlike yourself and Mr Malfoy\n"," And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive\n","What?\n","He saved his life\n","What?\n","Yes \n","Funny, the way people's minds work, isn't it?\n"," Professor Snape couldn't bear being in your father's debt I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even\n"," Then he could go back to hating your father's memory in peace\n"," Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped\n","And sir, there's one more thing \n","Just the one?\n","How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?\n"," It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something\n"," You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone find it, but not use it would be able to get it, otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life\n"," My brain surprises even me sometimes Now, enough questions\n"," I suggest you make a start on these sweets\n"," Ah! Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I'm afraid I've rather lost my liking for them but I think I'll be safe with a nice toffee, don't you?\n"," He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth\n","Alas! Ear wax!\n"," Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict\n","Just five minutes,\n"," Harry pleaded\n","Absolutely not\n","You let Professor Dumbledore in \n","Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different\n"," You need rest\n","I am resting, look, lying down and everything\n"," Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey \n","Oh, very well,\n","But five minutes only\n"," And she let Ron and Hermione in\n","Harry!\n"," Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore\n","Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to Dumbledore was so worried \n","The whole school's talking about it,\n","What really happened?\n"," It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors\n"," Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort\n"," Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell's turban, Hermione screamed out loud\n","So the Stone's gone?\n","Flamel's just going to die?\n","'\n","So what happened to you two?\n","Well, I got back all right,\n","D'you think he meant you to do it?\n","Sending you your father's cloak and everything?\n","Well, \n"," Hermione exploded, \n","if he did I mean to say that's terrible you could have been killed\n","No, it isn't,\n","He's a funny man, Dumbledore\n"," I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance\n"," I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know\n"," I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help\n"," I don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked\n"," It's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could \n","Yeah, Dumbledore's off his rocker, all right,\n","Listen, you've got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow\n"," The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you but the food'll be good\n"," At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over\n","You've had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT\n"," After a good night's sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal\n"," I want to go to the feast,\n"," he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes\n"," I can, can't I?\n","Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,\n","And you have another visitor\n","Oh, good,\n","Who is it?\n"," Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke\n"," As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed\n"," He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears\n","It's all my ruddy fault!\n"," he sobbed, his face in his hands\n"," I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn't know, an' I told him! Yeh could've died! All fer a dragon egg! I'll never drink again! I should be chucked out an' made ter live as a Muggle!\n","Hagrid!\n","Hagrid, he'd have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we're talking about, he'd have found out even if you hadn't told him\n","Yeh could've died!\n"," sobbed Hagrid\n","An' don' say the name!\n","VOLDEMORT!\n"," Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying\n","I've met him and I'm calling him by his name\n"," Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it's gone, he can't use it\n"," Have a Chocolate Frog, I've got loads\n","That reminds me\n"," I've got yeh a present\n","It's not a stoat sandwich, is it?\n","Nah\n"," Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it\n"," course, he shoulda sacked me instead anyway, got yeh this\n"," It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book\n"," Harry opened it curiously\n"," It was full of wizard photographs\n"," Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father\n","Sent owls off ter all yer parents' old school friends, askin' fer photos knew yeh didn' have any d'yeh like it?\n"," Harry couldn't speak, but Hagrid understood\n"," Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night\n"," He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full\n"," It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin's winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row\n"," A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table\n"," When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once\n"," He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him\n"," Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later\n"," The babble died away\n","Another year gone!\n","And I must trouble you with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast\n"," What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts\n","Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two\n"," A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table\n"," Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table\n"," It was a sickening sight\n","Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,\n","However, recent events must be taken into account\n"," The room went very still\n"," The Slytherins' smiles faded a little\n","Ahem,\n","I have a few last-minute points to dish out\n"," Let me see\n"," Yes \n","First to Mr Ronald Weasley \n"," Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn\n"," for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points\n"," Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver\n"," Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, \n","My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall's giant chess set!\n"," At last there was silence again\n","Second to Miss Hermione Granger for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points\n"," Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears\n"," Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves they were a hundred points up\n","Third to Mr Harry Potter \n"," The room went deadly quiet\n"," for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points\n"," The din was deafening\n"," Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points exactly the same as Slytherin\n"," They had tied for the house cup if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point\n"," Dumbledore raised his hand\n"," The room gradually fell silent\n","There are all kinds of courage,\n","It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends\n"," I therefore award ten points to Mr Neville Longbottom\n"," Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table\n"," Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him\n"," He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before\n"," Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him\n","Which means,\n"," Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, \n","we need a little change of decoration\n"," He clapped his hands\n"," In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place\n"," Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall's hand, with a horrible, forced smile\n"," He caught Harry's eye and Harry knew at once that Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot\n"," This didn't worry Harry\n"," It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts\n"," It was the best evening of Harry's life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls he would never, ever forget tonight\n"," Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did\n"," To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years\n"," Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one\n"," They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too\n"," And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville's toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (\n","I always hope they'll forget to give us these,\n"," It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform\n"," A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles\n","You must come and stay this summer,\n","both of you I'll send you an owl\n","Thanks,\n","I'll need something to look forward to\n"," People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world\n"," Some of them called: \n","Bye, Harry!\n","See you, Potter!\n","Still famous,\n","Not where I'm going, I promise you,\n"," He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together\n","There he is, Mom, there he is, look!\n"," It was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing at Ron\n","Harry Potter!\n"," she squealed\n","Look, Mom!
